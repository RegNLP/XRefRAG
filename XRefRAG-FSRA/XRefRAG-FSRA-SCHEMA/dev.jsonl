To figure out the right delay time, they need to check the average daily turnover (ADT) of the Financial Instrument. The rules provide a table that shows how long they can delay based on the ADT and the size of the transaction. For example, if the ADT is 100,000 USD or less, a transaction of at least 10,000 USD can be delayed for 60 minutes.

{"persona": "Professional", "question": "What obligations must a Payment Service Provider fulfill regarding the designation and use of a Payment Account to ensure compliance, given that no person other than the Payment Service Provider may have any interest in the Relevant Money?", "answer": "A Payment Service Provider is required to ensure that a Payment Account holding Relevant Money is designated in a manner that clearly indicates its purpose is to safeguard Relevant Money, as outlined in Chapter 14 of the applicable rules.
