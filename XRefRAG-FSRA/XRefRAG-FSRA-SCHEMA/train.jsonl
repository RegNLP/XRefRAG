{"persona": "Basic", "question": "What steps should an Authorised Person take to figure out the risk weight for a bank asset class CR Exposure without an external credit assessment, and how does the risk weight table fit into this?", "answer": "When an Authorised Person needs to determine the risk weight for a CR Exposure in the bank asset class without an external credit assessment, they should use the risk weight table as a guide. The risk weight should be the higher of two options: the weight from the table or the weight for a CR Exposure to the central government where the bank is based.

This categorisation is crucial for determining the Credit Risk Weight (CRW) applicable to each Exposure.

The process involves calculating the value of each Exposure, both on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet, in accordance with the specified measurement methodology. Once the Exposure value is determined, it must be categorised according to the relevant rules, which then allows for the allocation of a Credit Quality Grade and the appropriate risk weight.

{"persona": "Professional", "question": "How must a Recognised Clearing House use the most recent audited information when calculating capital requirements for operational risks and other specified risks?", "answer": "A Recognised Clearing House is required to use the most recent audited information from its annual financial statement when calculating capital requirements. This includes ensuring that operational expenses are aligned with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as part of the procedure. The capital requirements must cover various risks, including winding down or restructuring activities, operational risks, credit and counterparty credit risks, market risks, and business risks. Specifically, for operational risks, the Recognised Clearing House must calculate its capital requirement using either the Basic Indicator Approach or, with prior authorisation, the Standardised or Alternative Standardised Approach. Additionally, for credit and counterparty credit risks, the capital requirements are calculated as a percentage of risk-weighted exposure amounts, with specific risk weights applied to exposures related to other clearing houses. The business risk capital requirement must be based on an approved estimate of potential losses from adverse scenarios, subject to a minimum threshold.

Additionally, it encompasses those who obtain such information by other means and are aware, or should reasonably be expected to be aware, of its nature as Inside Information.

According to Appendix A1, Fund Managers and Trustees, if they have one, must make sure that any delegation or outsourcing agreements they enter into meet certain standards. These agreements need to clearly outline the tasks and service levels, and they can't be further delegated or outsourced without approval.

{"persona": "Basic", "question": "When can't an Authorised Person take a Retail Client referral from someone who isn't regulated?", "answer": "An Authorised Person must not accept a referral of a Retail Client made by an unregulated Person where doing so involves the disbursement of a reward, whether monetary or non-monetary in nature, from the Authorised Person to the unregulated Person.

(c) Procedures to ensure that the legal characteristics of netting arrangements are kept under review in light of the possible changes in relevant law.", "reference_text": "A4.6.14 to A4.6.21 of App 4", "reference_type": "Internal", "generator_model": "gpt-4o", "pipeline_version": "SCHEMA_v1.1", "created_at": "2025-11-23", "judge_passed": true, "judge_final_score": 10, "judge_subscores": {"realism": 2, "dual_use": 4, "correctness": 4}, "judge_fused": {"passed": true, "final_score": 10, "subscores": {"realism": 2, "dual_use": 4, "correctness": 4}, "reasons": ["fused_median_scores_over_ensemble"], "ensemble": {"n": 3}}, "judge_per_judge": [{"model": "gpt-4.1-mini", "seed": 13, "tag": "gpt-4.1-mini@seed:13", "result": {"passed": true, "final_score": 10, "subscores": {"realism": 2, "dual_use": 4, "correctness": 4}, "reasons": ["Question is naturally phrased and relevant to compliance context", "Answer requires both SOURCE (exposure calculation) and TARGET (netting requirements) to be fully correct", "Answer accurately reflects both passages without hallucination or contradiction"], "flags": {"hard_gate_fail": false, "question_has_citation": false}}}, {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "seed": 13, "tag": "gpt-4o-mini@seed:13", "result": {"passed": false, "final_score": 0, "subscores": {"realism": 2, "dual_use": 4, "correctness": 4}, "reasons": ["The question is realistic and natural for compliance, asking about specific regulatory requirements.", "The question requires both SOURCE and TARGET to answer correctly, as it involves both exposure calculation and netting requirements.", "The answer is correct and accurately reflects the information from both SOURCE and TARGET."], "flags": {"hard_gate_fail": true, "question_has_citation": true}}}, {"model": "gpt-4.1-mini", "seed": 17, "tag": "gpt-4.1-mini@seed:17", "result": {"passed": true, "final_score": 10, "subscores": {"realism": 2, "dual_use": 4, "correctness": 4}, "reasons": ["Question is naturally phrased and relevant to compliance context", "Answer requires both SOURCE (exposure calculation) and TARGET (netting requirements) to be fully correct", "Answer accurately reflects both passages without hallucination or contradiction"], "flags": {"hard_gate_fail": false, "question_has_citation": false}}}], "ir_agreement": {"num_rel": 2, "num_methods_hit_any": 4, "num_methods_hit_all": 0, "high_concordance_any": true, "low_concordance_any": false, "k": 10, "methods": {"bge.txt": {"rel_in_topk": 1, "hit_any": true, "hit_all": false, "first_hit_rank": 4}, "bm25.txt": {"rel_in_topk": 1, "hit_any": true, "hit_all": false, "first_hit_rank": 9}, "bm25_e5_rerank.txt": {"rel_in_topk": 0, "hit_any": false, "hit_all": false, "first_hit_rank": null}, "e5.txt": {"rel_in_topk": 1, "hit_any": true, "hit_all": false, "first_hit_rank": 1}, "hybrid_rrf_bm25_e5.txt": {"rel_in_topk": 1, "hit_any": true, "hit_all": false, "first_hit_rank": 5}}}, "id": "SCHEMA_000102", "method": "SCHEMA", "split": "train"}
