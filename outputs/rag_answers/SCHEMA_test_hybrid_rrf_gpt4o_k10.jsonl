The exposure value is determined by summing the on-balance sheet value, calculated in accordance with IFRS, and an add-on for PFE, which is calculated according to specific rules. The Standardised Approach to Counterparty Credit Risk (SA-CCR) is used to determine the exposure at default (EAD) for derivatives.\n\n- The on-balance sheet value of derivatives should be calculated in accordance with IFRS, including any written credit protection.

[#P:696b66b8-fa0b-4bd0-80cd-98ac02852918]\n- The replacement cost and PFE must be calculated differently for margined and unmargined netting sets, with the EAD for a margined netting set capped at the EAD of the same netting set calculated on an unmargined basis.

This late submission constitutes a breach of a Rule, and the Regulator may take further action beyond imposing the fee. For Designated Non-Financial Businesses or Professions, this rule specifically applies to the late submission of the AML Return, as mandated by the Anti-Money Laundering and Sanctions Rules and Guidance Rulebook. The imposition of the late fee is governed by Rule 1.2.7, which outlines the financial penalty for late submissions. It is important to note that the Regulator has the discretion to pursue additional measures in response to the breach, although the specific nature of these actions is not detailed in the provided context. Therefore, timely submission of Regulatory Filings is crucial to avoid penalties and potential further regulatory actions.

When considering the FATF Recommendations, in combination with the application of the AML Rules, the FSRA notes the following key principles that an Authorised Person conducting Regulated Activities using Spot Commodities should consider:\n\nPrinciple 1: Risk Based Approach\n\na)\tFATF expects countries, regulators, financial institutions and other concerned parties to adopt a ‘Risk Based Approach’ (“RBA”).  Authorised Persons are expected to understand the risks associated with their activities and allocate proper resources to mitigate those risks.  A RBA can only be achieved if it is embedded into the compliance culture of the Authorised Person, which enables the Authorised Person to make decisions and allocate appropriate resources in the most efficient and effective way.\n\nb)\tAuthorised Persons should, on a periodic basis, carry out a proper risk based assessment of their processes and activities.  In order to implement the RBA, Authorised Persons are expected to have processes in place to identify, assess, monitor, manage and mitigate ML risks.  The general principle is that in circumstances where there are higher risks of ML, Authorised Persons are required to implement enhanced measures to manage and mitigate those risks.\n\nc)\tWith the use of Spot Commodities being largely unregulated within financial services, any financial institution banking an Authorised Person conducting Regulated Activities using Spot Commodities must not only satisfy itself, but also its foreign correspondent financial institution(s), that the Authorised Person is well regulated and has appropriate systems and controls in place to address ML, TF and sanctions risks.  These systems and controls should include robust processes to carry out ‘customer risk assessment’ and ‘customer due diligence’ checks (collectively, “CDD”) on Clients and beneficial owners, to monitor transactions for these risks, and the willingness and ability of the Authorised Person to provide complete transparency to its financial institution(s) and foreign correspondent financial institution(s) if and when required.\n\nPrinciple 2: Business Risk Assessment\n\nd)\tChapter 6 of the AML Rules requires Relevant Persons to take appropriate steps to identify and assess the ML risks to which their businesses are exposed, taking into consideration the nature, size and complexity of their activities.  Importantly, in the context of Spot Commodities, FATF Recommendation (15) states that:\n\n“Countries and financial institutions should identify and assess the money laundering or terrorist financing risks that may arise in relation to (a) the development of new products and new business practices, including new delivery mechanisms, and (b) the use of new or developing technologies for both new and pre-existing products. In the case of financial institutions, such a risk assessment should take place prior to the launch of the new products, business practices or the use of new or developing technologies. They should take appropriate measures to manage and mitigate those risks.”\n\ne)\tAnother aspect of assessing the business risk relevant to Authorised Persons is gaining familiarity with the characteristics and terminology  of the Spot Commodity industry.  Additionally, Authorised Persons, and their management and staff, should be aware of the possible misuse of Spot Commodities in criminal activities, as well as the physical nature of Spot Commodities (including delivery and storage facilities).\n\nf)\tWhen making its assessment, an Authorised Person must give consideration to all business risks.  For example, while an issue may be identified in relation to delivery soundness, the FSRA expects Authorised Persons to consider these risks from all perspectives to establish whether the risk triggers other issues for consideration (including ML/TF risks, technology governance and consumer protection).  An Authorised Person must then use the identified risks to develop and maintain its AML/CTF policies, procedures, systems and controls and take all reasonable steps to eliminate or manage such risks.\n\nPrinciple 3: Due Diligence\n\ng)\tThe Authorised Person, where it is operating an MTF or OTF, is to assess whether a potential Member is adequately regulated in its home jurisdiction, such that the Authorised Person can suitably rely on its Members, to undertake Customer Risk Assessment and CDD checks.  Where Members/Clients are not properly regulated, the FSRA expects that MTFs or OTFs will centralise the relevant compliance activities internally (and not be able to rely on their ‘members’ for such purposes).\n\nh)\tCDD rules, policies and procedures are required to be implemented by all Authorised Persons.  Authorised Persons should have a process to ensure its Members (and/or in relevant circumstances, itself) assess all Clients according to the Client’s risk profile (and taking into consideration the Authorised Person’s RBA).  This risk-based assessment is required to be undertaken for each Client prior to transacting any business on behalf of the Client.  Authorised Persons must, as applicable, ensure CDD is undertaken for each Client and comply in full with Chapter 8 of the AML Rules noting that the FSRA does not consider it appropriate for Authorised Persons (or its Members, as applicable) to use simplified CDD when conducting Regulated Activities using Accepted Spot Commodities.\n\nPrinciple 4: Governance, Systems and Controls\n\ni)\tAuthorised Persons are required to implement an appropriate governance structure, especially in relation to physical due diligence, and provide for the development and maintenance of all necessary controls to ensure appropriate ML and TF compliance.\n\nj)\tThe FSRA expects Authorised Persons to act responsibly and always be vigilant in ensuring that their activities are not subject to any misuse by participants with Spot Commodities that may have been tainted in any way from illegal or unethical sourcing.  The FSRA expects that an Authorised Person’s internal processes establish the types of ‘indicators’ or activities that could be used to identify when Accepted Spot Commodities may have been used or sourced in an illegal manner.", "document_id": 34, "passage_id": "62)"}, {"pid": "15342a58-7502-411f-b363-0b8b97f42fe8", "text": "REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS - SPOT COMMODITY ACTIVITIES\nDelivery & Storage\nWhen applying COBS Rules 22.4.5 and 22.4.6, an Authorised Person should have arrangements in place to allow Members to fulfil their delivery obligations, or other appropriate measures of resolution and restitution, to ensure the Authorised Person is able to operate on a fair and orderly basis.

This means that such transactions are included in the calculation of the number of Relevant Issues, which affects the maximum number of new Equity Securities that can be issued without approval. Specifically, the formula for calculating the maximum number of Equity Securities that can be issued without approval is: Maximum number of Equity Securities = (20% * Base Amount) – Relevant Issues. The Relevant Issues include the number of Equity Securities issued or agreed to be issued in the 12 months before the date of issue or agreement, excluding those issued with approval or under certain exceptions. Therefore, the sale or reissue of forfeited Equity Securities increases the count of Relevant Issues, potentially reducing the number of new Equity Securities that can be issued without obtaining approval from the holders of Ordinary Securities.

Authorised Persons are expected to understand the risks associated with their activities and allocate proper resources to mitigate those risks. A RBA can only be achieved if it is embedded into the compliance culture of the Authorised Person, which enables the Authorised Person to make decisions and allocate appropriate resources in the most efficient and effective way.\n\nb)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 1: Risk Based Approach\nAuthorised Persons should, on a periodic basis, carry out a proper risk based assessment of their processes and activities. In order to implement the RBA, Authorised Persons are expected to have processes in place to identify, assess, monitor, manage and mitigate ML risks. The general principle is that in circumstances where there are higher risks of ML, Authorised Persons are required to implement enhanced measures to manage and mitigate those risks.\n\nc)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 1: Risk Based Approach\nOne of the most challenging risks facing financial institutions is how the on-boarding of an Authorised Person may affect its relationship with foreign correspondent financial institutions, as well as the views of the regulator of those foreign correspondent financial institutions. In essence, a foreign correspondent financial institution relationship is built on the effectiveness of a financial institution’s ML compliance program and ongoing monitoring capabilities.\n\nd)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 1: Risk Based Approach\nWith the use of cryptology and block chain technologies at a nascent stage within financial services, any financial institution banking an Authorised Person must not only satisfy itself, but also its foreign correspondent financial institution(s), that the Authorised Person is well regulated and has appropriate systems and controls in place to address ML, TF and sanctions risks.  These systems and controls should include robust processes to carry out CDD on Clients and beneficial owners, to monitor transactions for these risks, and the willingness and ability of the Authorised Person to provide complete transparency to its financial institution(s) and foreign correspondent financial institution(s) if and when required.\n\n\ne)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 2: Business Risk Assessment\nChapter 6 of the AML Rules requires Relevant Persons to take appropriate steps to identify and assess the ML risks to which their businesses are exposed, taking into consideration the nature, size and complexity of their activities. When identifying and assessing these risks, several factors should be considered, including an assessment of the use of new technologies.  Importantly, in the context of Virtual Assets, FATF Recommendation (15) states that:\n\n“Countries and financial institutions should identify and assess the money laundering or terrorist financing risks that may arise in relation to (a) the development of new products and new business practices, including new delivery mechanisms, and (b) the use of new or developing technologies for both new and pre-existing products. In the case of financial institutions, such a risk assessment should take place prior to the launch of the new products, business practices or the use of new or developing technologies. They should take appropriate measures to manage and mitigate those risks.”\n\nf)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 2: Business Risk Assessment\nAnother aspect of assessing the business risk relevant to Authorised Persons is gaining familiarity with the characteristics and terminology  of the Virtual Asset industry. Additionally, Authorised Persons, and their management and staff, should be aware of the possible misuse of Virtual Assets in criminal activities, as well as the technical and complicated nature of Virtual Assets (and the platforms they operate on).\n\ng)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 2: Business Risk Assessment\nWhen making its assessment, an Authorised Person must give consideration to all business risks. For example, while an issue may be identified in relation to cyber security (e.g., when dealing with hot wallets or using cloud computing to store data – being a ‘technology’ risk), the FSRA expects Authorised Persons to consider these risks from all perspectives to establish whether the risk triggers other issues for consideration (including ML/TF risks, technology governance and consumer protection).  An Authorised Person must then use the identified risks to develop and maintain its AML/CTF policies, procedures, systems and controls and take all reasonable steps to eliminate or manage such risks.\n\n\nh)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 3: Customer Risk Assessment and Customer Due Diligence\nThe FSRA expects all Authorised Persons to have fully compliant Client on-boarding processes.  Virtual Assets have been criticised by regulatory bodies globally due to their (pseudo-)anonymity features, which makes tracking Client records and transactions more challenging for compliance officers and money laundering reporting officers.\n\ni)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 3: Customer Risk Assessment and Customer Due Diligence\nCustomer Risk Assessment and ‘Customer Due Diligence’ (“CDD”) policies and procedures are required to be implemented by all Authorised Persons. Authorised Persons should have a process to assess and rate all their Clients according to that Client’s risk profile (and taking into consideration the Authorised Persons’ RBA). This risk-based assessment is required to be undertaken for each Client prior to transacting any business on behalf of the Client. Authorised Persons must undertake CDD for each Client and comply in full with Chapter 8 of the AML Rules noting that the FSRA does not consider it appropriate for Authorised Persons to use simplified CDD when conducting a Regulated Activity in relation to Virtual Assets, largely due to issues surrounding the (pseudo-) anonymity of Clients and transactions associated with Virtual Assets.\n\nj)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 3: Customer Risk Assessment and Customer Due Diligence\nIn the case of non-face-to-face on-boarding and ongoing due diligence of Clients who are natural persons, the FSRA expects that an Authorised Person will develop appropriate policies to ensure that the Client’s identity is duly verified in accordance with all applicable Laws and Rules. This may include obtaining a “selfie” or by conducting a “liveness test”. Irrespective of the method employed, it should validate that the individual being on-boarded is present during the on-boarding process, matches the individual in the identity documentation, and that the ID presented is valid and authentic. It should also include obtaining and authenticating a valid form of the Client’s facial ID, which should be either the Client’s passport with all applicable details clear and, or the original version (front and back) of an official government issued document, such as a national ID or driver’s license. For the purposes of residents of the UAE, the primary form of documentation used should be the Client’s Emirates ID card.\n\nk)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 3: Customer Risk Assessment and Customer Due Diligence\nThe FSRA understands that Authorised Persons may need to use new technology to improve Client on-boarding processes for the purpose of assessing and managing ML and TF risks.  For example, in order for Authorised Persons to conduct non-face-to-face on-boarding they will need to implement facial recognition software to validate the “selfie” against the other uploaded documentation, or other suitable biometric technology.\n\nl)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 3: Customer Risk Assessment and Customer Due Diligence\nThe FSRA further understands that the proper use of such technologies (e.g., fingerprinting, retinal/eye scans, use of real-time video conference facilities to enable facial recognition) can assist with mitigation of the ML/TF risks associated with the use of Virtual Assets.  Technological features, such as secure digital signatures that allow the verification of a Client’s identity through a signed document, may also be acceptable to the FSRA. In all cases, an Authorised Person should ensure that the use of these technologies will not lead to a simplified process where the required Customer Risk Assessment and CDD requirements are not appropriately undertaken by an Authorised Person.\n\nm)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 3: Customer Risk Assessment and Customer Due Diligence\nThe FSRA recommends that Authorised Persons obtain a signed self-certification from their Clients identifying the details of all passports issued and held in their name(s). Authorised Persons may also use this as an opportunity to capture all tax related details in order to meet their international tax reporting obligations. Self-certification should not prevent Authorised Persons from conducting proper CDD.\n\n\nn)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 4: Governance, Systems and Controls\nAuthorised Persons are required to implement an appropriate governance structure, especially in relation to Information Technology governance , and provide for the development and maintenance of all necessary systems and controls to ensure appropriate ML and TF compliance.\n\no)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 4: Governance, Systems and Controls\nThe FSRA expects that Authorised Persons may seek to utilise (their own or third-party) technologies and solutions to meet their regulatory obligations (e.g., customer risk assessment, detection of fraud, and transaction identification, monitoring and reporting) and risk management requirements (e.g., margin limits, large exposure monitoring).\n\np)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 4: Governance, Systems and Controls\nThe FSRA expects Authorised Persons to develop, implement and maintain effective transactional monitoring systems to determine the origin of a Virtual Asset and to monitor its destination, and to apply strong “know your transaction” measures which enable Authorised Persons to have complete granular data centric information about the transactions done by a Client.\n\nq)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 4: Governance, Systems and Controls\nThe FSRA expects Authorised Persons to act responsibly and always be vigilant in ensuring that their activities are not subject to any misuse by participants transacting with Virtual Assets that may have been tainted in any way from an illegal activity.  The FSRA expects that an Authorised Person’s internal processes establish the types of ‘indicators’ or activities that could be used to identify when Accepted Virtual Assets may have been used in an illegal manner.  An Authorised Person should have a process for the management of when such ‘indicators’ (for example, certain Client or use of “mixer” and “tumbler” services) are triggered.\n\nr)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 4: Governance, Systems and Controls\nWhile the FSRA cannot recommend particular vendors or providers, all technology solutions must be fit for purpose and Authorised Persons should consider using those with an established track record, and undertake their own due diligence/risk assessment to ensure competency and capability.  The FSRA recognises that many of the (technology) solutions appropriate for mitigating Virtual Asset risks are continuing to be developed within the Virtual Asset industry itself.\n\ns)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 4: Governance, Systems and Controls\nThe FSRA expects Authorised Persons to develop, implement and adhere to a “Virtual Asset Compliance Policy”, tailored to meet specific Virtual Asset business compliance requirements, and reflecting a clear comprehension of the Authorised Person’s understanding of its compliance responsibilities.  The FSRA expects this policy to be well defined, comprehensive, robust and as specific to an individual Authorised Person’s activities as possible. The policy can be separate or part of other compliance policies/manuals.\n\nt)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 4: Governance, Systems and Controls\nFollowing the development of the Virtual Asset Compliance Policy, Authorised Persons’ compliance officers are expected to establish a “Virtual Asset compliance monitoring program”, requiring internal reviews to be conducted in an efficient way, and on a periodic basis.\n\nu)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 4: Governance, Systems and Controls\nAuthorised Persons must appoint a Money Laundering Reporting Officer (“MLRO”) who will be responsible for the implementation and oversight of the Authorised Person’s compliance with the AML Rules.  Consistent with the FSRA’s expectation in relation to all other Authorised Persons, an MLRO should have an appropriate level of seniority and independence in order to be effective in the role.\n\nv)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 5: Suspicious Activity Reporting obligations\nAuthorised Persons should familiarise themselves with their reporting obligations under the AML Rules, in particular in relation to the reporting of suspicious activities/transactions.\n\nw)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 5: Suspicious Activity Reporting obligations\nPrior to commencing operations, the FSRA expects Authorised Persons to establish online connectivity with the UAE’s Financial Intelligence Unit for the purposes of submitting Suspicious Activity Reports (“SARs”). Instructions on how to do this can be found on the FSRA’s FCPU webpage.\n\nx)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 5: Suspicious Activity Reporting obligations\nAuthorised Persons are required to establish sophisticated transaction monitoring systems to detect possible ML and TF activities. Systems should also be implemented to effectively identify any attempt to breach domestic and international sanctions. Such systems may rely on new technological solutions (including monitoring algorithms or Artificial Intelligence (“AI”)).\n\ny)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 6: Record keeping\nAs proper documentation is one of the main pillars of ensuring AML/CFT compliance, Authorised Persons are required to have policies and procedures in place to ensure proper record keeping practices. It is expected that an Authorised Person will maintain up to date records in accordance with the CDD obligations applicable to it and be prepared to provide the records upon request from the FSRA.\n\nz)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 6: Record keeping\nThe FSRA understands that the transaction recording of many Virtual Asset transactions is linked to, or based on, DLT. This requires an Authorised Person to implement specific arrangements to ensure that, at a minimum, the Authorised Person and the FSRA have access to all relevant information as necessary. An Authorised Person may use a distributed ledger to store its data, provided it is able to provide this data, in an easily accessible format, to the FSRA when required.\n\naa)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 6: Record keeping\nThe FSRA views Virtual Asset activities that are linked to cash transactions as posing higher ML and TF risks, due to the source of funding being significantly more difficult to determine. Authorised Persons wishing to conduct cash transactions will be required to implement enhanced controls to mitigate the inherent risks of such transactions. Such controls may include, among other things, setting appropriate limits on cash deposits (e.g., daily, monthly, yearly limits), a prohibition on receiving cash directly, prohibitions on the receipt of cash other than from bank accounts, and prohibitions on receiving funds from third parties. In all cases, Authorised Persons will need to clearly demonstrate to the FSRA how their controls suitably mitigate the risks of cash transactions within their operations. Considering the wider consumer protection implications, the FSRA also considers it unlikely to be appropriate for Authorised Persons to accept deposits by way of credit card or credit facilities/credit lines.\n\nbb)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 6: Record keeping\nFSRA expects all Authorised Persons to exercise due care, to the utmost extent possible, in their day-to-day operations and when dealing with Clients or potential Clients.
