The trader then unwinds his position in the Exchange's final settlement window  at rapidly increasing prices, thereby cornering/squeezing the crude oil market.  His conduct causes an abnormal movement in the price of crude oil contracts for forward month delivery; and\n(b)\ta trader with a long position in bond futures, buys or borrows a large amount of the bonds and either refuses to re-lend these bonds or will only lend them to parties he believes will not re-lend to the market.  His purpose is to position the price at which persons with short positions have to deliver to satisfy their obligations at a materially higher level, making him a profit on his position.", "document_id": 22, "passage_id": "2.2.(13)"}, {"pid": "30b28a01-ff32-49d3-94aa-70030d617b9d", "text": "Chinese walls.

Authorised Persons are expected to understand the risks associated with their activities and allocate proper resources to mitigate those risks. A RBA can only be achieved if it is embedded into the compliance culture of the Authorised Person, which enables the Authorised Person to make decisions and allocate appropriate resources in the most efficient and effective way.\n\nb)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 1: Risk Based Approach\nAuthorised Persons should, on a periodic basis, carry out a proper risk based assessment of their processes and activities. In order to implement the RBA, Authorised Persons are expected to have processes in place to identify, assess, monitor, manage and mitigate ML risks. The general principle is that in circumstances where there are higher risks of ML, Authorised Persons are required to implement enhanced measures to manage and mitigate those risks.\n\nc)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 1: Risk Based Approach\nOne of the most challenging risks facing financial institutions is how the on-boarding of an Authorised Person may affect its relationship with foreign correspondent financial institutions, as well as the views of the regulator of those foreign correspondent financial institutions. In essence, a foreign correspondent financial institution relationship is built on the effectiveness of a financial institution’s ML compliance program and ongoing monitoring capabilities.\n\nd)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 1: Risk Based Approach\nWith the use of cryptology and block chain technologies at a nascent stage within financial services, any financial institution banking an Authorised Person must not only satisfy itself, but also its foreign correspondent financial institution(s), that the Authorised Person is well regulated and has appropriate systems and controls in place to address ML, TF and sanctions risks.  These systems and controls should include robust processes to carry out CDD on Clients and beneficial owners, to monitor transactions for these risks, and the willingness and ability of the Authorised Person to provide complete transparency to its financial institution(s) and foreign correspondent financial institution(s) if and when required.\n\n\ne)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 2: Business Risk Assessment\nChapter 6 of the AML Rules requires Relevant Persons to take appropriate steps to identify and assess the ML risks to which their businesses are exposed, taking into consideration the nature, size and complexity of their activities. When identifying and assessing these risks, several factors should be considered, including an assessment of the use of new technologies.  Importantly, in the context of Virtual Assets, FATF Recommendation (15) states that:\n\n“Countries and financial institutions should identify and assess the money laundering or terrorist financing risks that may arise in relation to (a) the development of new products and new business practices, including new delivery mechanisms, and (b) the use of new or developing technologies for both new and pre-existing products. In the case of financial institutions, such a risk assessment should take place prior to the launch of the new products, business practices or the use of new or developing technologies. They should take appropriate measures to manage and mitigate those risks.”\n\nf)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 2: Business Risk Assessment\nAnother aspect of assessing the business risk relevant to Authorised Persons is gaining familiarity with the characteristics and terminology  of the Virtual Asset industry. Additionally, Authorised Persons, and their management and staff, should be aware of the possible misuse of Virtual Assets in criminal activities, as well as the technical and complicated nature of Virtual Assets (and the platforms they operate on).\n\ng)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 2: Business Risk Assessment\nWhen making its assessment, an Authorised Person must give consideration to all business risks. For example, while an issue may be identified in relation to cyber security (e.g., when dealing with hot wallets or using cloud computing to store data – being a ‘technology’ risk), the FSRA expects Authorised Persons to consider these risks from all perspectives to establish whether the risk triggers other issues for consideration (including ML/TF risks, technology governance and consumer protection).  An Authorised Person must then use the identified risks to develop and maintain its AML/CTF policies, procedures, systems and controls and take all reasonable steps to eliminate or manage such risks.\n\n\nh)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 3: Customer Risk Assessment and Customer Due Diligence\nThe FSRA expects all Authorised Persons to have fully compliant Client on-boarding processes.  Virtual Assets have been criticised by regulatory bodies globally due to their (pseudo-)anonymity features, which makes tracking Client records and transactions more challenging for compliance officers and money laundering reporting officers.\n\ni)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 3: Customer Risk Assessment and Customer Due Diligence\nCustomer Risk Assessment and ‘Customer Due Diligence’ (“CDD”) policies and procedures are required to be implemented by all Authorised Persons. Authorised Persons should have a process to assess and rate all their Clients according to that Client’s risk profile (and taking into consideration the Authorised Persons’ RBA). This risk-based assessment is required to be undertaken for each Client prior to transacting any business on behalf of the Client. Authorised Persons must undertake CDD for each Client and comply in full with Chapter 8 of the AML Rules noting that the FSRA does not consider it appropriate for Authorised Persons to use simplified CDD when conducting a Regulated Activity in relation to Virtual Assets, largely due to issues surrounding the (pseudo-) anonymity of Clients and transactions associated with Virtual Assets.\n\nj)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 3: Customer Risk Assessment and Customer Due Diligence\nIn the case of non-face-to-face on-boarding and ongoing due diligence of Clients who are natural persons, the FSRA expects that an Authorised Person will develop appropriate policies to ensure that the Client’s identity is duly verified in accordance with all applicable Laws and Rules. This may include obtaining a “selfie” or by conducting a “liveness test”. Irrespective of the method employed, it should validate that the individual being on-boarded is present during the on-boarding process, matches the individual in the identity documentation, and that the ID presented is valid and authentic. It should also include obtaining and authenticating a valid form of the Client’s facial ID, which should be either the Client’s passport with all applicable details clear and, or the original version (front and back) of an official government issued document, such as a national ID or driver’s license. For the purposes of residents of the UAE, the primary form of documentation used should be the Client’s Emirates ID card.\n\nk)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 3: Customer Risk Assessment and Customer Due Diligence\nThe FSRA understands that Authorised Persons may need to use new technology to improve Client on-boarding processes for the purpose of assessing and managing ML and TF risks.  For example, in order for Authorised Persons to conduct non-face-to-face on-boarding they will need to implement facial recognition software to validate the “selfie” against the other uploaded documentation, or other suitable biometric technology.\n\nl)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 3: Customer Risk Assessment and Customer Due Diligence\nThe FSRA further understands that the proper use of such technologies (e.g., fingerprinting, retinal/eye scans, use of real-time video conference facilities to enable facial recognition) can assist with mitigation of the ML/TF risks associated with the use of Virtual Assets.  Technological features, such as secure digital signatures that allow the verification of a Client’s identity through a signed document, may also be acceptable to the FSRA. In all cases, an Authorised Person should ensure that the use of these technologies will not lead to a simplified process where the required Customer Risk Assessment and CDD requirements are not appropriately undertaken by an Authorised Person.\n\nm)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 3: Customer Risk Assessment and Customer Due Diligence\nThe FSRA recommends that Authorised Persons obtain a signed self-certification from their Clients identifying the details of all passports issued and held in their name(s). Authorised Persons may also use this as an opportunity to capture all tax related details in order to meet their international tax reporting obligations. Self-certification should not prevent Authorised Persons from conducting proper CDD.\n\n\nn)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 4: Governance, Systems and Controls\nAuthorised Persons are required to implement an appropriate governance structure, especially in relation to Information Technology governance , and provide for the development and maintenance of all necessary systems and controls to ensure appropriate ML and TF compliance.\n\no)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 4: Governance, Systems and Controls\nThe FSRA expects that Authorised Persons may seek to utilise (their own or third-party) technologies and solutions to meet their regulatory obligations (e.g., customer risk assessment, detection of fraud, and transaction identification, monitoring and reporting) and risk management requirements (e.g., margin limits, large exposure monitoring).\n\np)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 4: Governance, Systems and Controls\nThe FSRA expects Authorised Persons to develop, implement and maintain effective transactional monitoring systems to determine the origin of a Virtual Asset and to monitor its destination, and to apply strong “know your transaction” measures which enable Authorised Persons to have complete granular data centric information about the transactions done by a Client.\n\nq)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 4: Governance, Systems and Controls\nThe FSRA expects Authorised Persons to act responsibly and always be vigilant in ensuring that their activities are not subject to any misuse by participants transacting with Virtual Assets that may have been tainted in any way from an illegal activity.  The FSRA expects that an Authorised Person’s internal processes establish the types of ‘indicators’ or activities that could be used to identify when Accepted Virtual Assets may have been used in an illegal manner.  An Authorised Person should have a process for the management of when such ‘indicators’ (for example, certain Client or use of “mixer” and “tumbler” services) are triggered.\n\nr)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 4: Governance, Systems and Controls\nWhile the FSRA cannot recommend particular vendors or providers, all technology solutions must be fit for purpose and Authorised Persons should consider using those with an established track record, and undertake their own due diligence/risk assessment to ensure competency and capability.  The FSRA recognises that many of the (technology) solutions appropriate for mitigating Virtual Asset risks are continuing to be developed within the Virtual Asset industry itself.\n\ns)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 4: Governance, Systems and Controls\nThe FSRA expects Authorised Persons to develop, implement and adhere to a “Virtual Asset Compliance Policy”, tailored to meet specific Virtual Asset business compliance requirements, and reflecting a clear comprehension of the Authorised Person’s understanding of its compliance responsibilities.  The FSRA expects this policy to be well defined, comprehensive, robust and as specific to an individual Authorised Person’s activities as possible. The policy can be separate or part of other compliance policies/manuals.\n\nt)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 4: Governance, Systems and Controls\nFollowing the development of the Virtual Asset Compliance Policy, Authorised Persons’ compliance officers are expected to establish a “Virtual Asset compliance monitoring program”, requiring internal reviews to be conducted in an efficient way, and on a periodic basis.\n\nu)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 4: Governance, Systems and Controls\nAuthorised Persons must appoint a Money Laundering Reporting Officer (“MLRO”) who will be responsible for the implementation and oversight of the Authorised Person’s compliance with the AML Rules.  Consistent with the FSRA’s expectation in relation to all other Authorised Persons, an MLRO should have an appropriate level of seniority and independence in order to be effective in the role.\n\nv)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 5: Suspicious Activity Reporting obligations\nAuthorised Persons should familiarise themselves with their reporting obligations under the AML Rules, in particular in relation to the reporting of suspicious activities/transactions.\n\nw)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 5: Suspicious Activity Reporting obligations\nPrior to commencing operations, the FSRA expects Authorised Persons to establish online connectivity with the UAE’s Financial Intelligence Unit for the purposes of submitting Suspicious Activity Reports (“SARs”). Instructions on how to do this can be found on the FSRA’s FCPU webpage.\n\nx)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 5: Suspicious Activity Reporting obligations\nAuthorised Persons are required to establish sophisticated transaction monitoring systems to detect possible ML and TF activities. Systems should also be implemented to effectively identify any attempt to breach domestic and international sanctions. Such systems may rely on new technological solutions (including monitoring algorithms or Artificial Intelligence (“AI”)).\n\ny)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 6: Record keeping\nAs proper documentation is one of the main pillars of ensuring AML/CFT compliance, Authorised Persons are required to have policies and procedures in place to ensure proper record keeping practices. It is expected that an Authorised Person will maintain up to date records in accordance with the CDD obligations applicable to it and be prepared to provide the records upon request from the FSRA.\n\nz)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 6: Record keeping\nThe FSRA understands that the transaction recording of many Virtual Asset transactions is linked to, or based on, DLT. This requires an Authorised Person to implement specific arrangements to ensure that, at a minimum, the Authorised Person and the FSRA have access to all relevant information as necessary. An Authorised Person may use a distributed ledger to store its data, provided it is able to provide this data, in an easily accessible format, to the FSRA when required.\n\naa)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 6: Record keeping\nThe FSRA views Virtual Asset activities that are linked to cash transactions as posing higher ML and TF risks, due to the source of funding being significantly more difficult to determine. Authorised Persons wishing to conduct cash transactions will be required to implement enhanced controls to mitigate the inherent risks of such transactions. Such controls may include, among other things, setting appropriate limits on cash deposits (e.g., daily, monthly, yearly limits), a prohibition on receiving cash directly, prohibitions on the receipt of cash other than from bank accounts, and prohibitions on receiving funds from third parties. In all cases, Authorised Persons will need to clearly demonstrate to the FSRA how their controls suitably mitigate the risks of cash transactions within their operations. Considering the wider consumer protection implications, the FSRA also considers it unlikely to be appropriate for Authorised Persons to accept deposits by way of credit card or credit facilities/credit lines.\n\nbb)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 6: Record keeping\nFSRA expects all Authorised Persons to exercise due care, to the utmost extent possible, in their day-to-day operations and when dealing with Clients or potential Clients.

Some key considerations for PFP Applicants are the following:\n(a)\tBusiness Model\nThe FSRA will consider the PFP Applicant’s proposed business model and assess any potential risks it poses. In particular, the FSRA will consider:\n(i)\tthe nature and structure of the products offered on the PFP;\n(ii)\tthe PFP Applicant’s target Clients;\n(iii)\tthe roles and responsibilities of the PFP Applicant;\n(iv)\twhether the Applicant will carry out primary and/or secondary trading;\n(v)\twhether the PFP Applicant might have any perceived conflicts of interest when authorised and how these might be managed;\n(vi)\tany proposed outsourcing arrangements with third party service providers;\n(vii)\twhether the PFP Applicant is proposing to carry out any other Regulated Activities; and\n(viii)\tthe safekeeping arrangements for Client Assets if the PFP Applicant intends to hold these.\nIn the case that a PFP Applicant proposes to carry out other Regulated Activities such as Operating a MTF, Advising on Investments or Credit, Managing Assets or Managing a Collective Investment Fund, the PFP Applicant would need to demonstrate how it would manage any potential conflicts of interest that these activities may pose.\n(b)\tTrack Record\nA PFP Applicant should demonstrate that it or its Group has an established track record in corporate finance or a related business, of a minimum of five years, in a jurisdiction that has a legislative and regulatory framework that is of comparable standard to that of the FSRA. The PFP Applicant or its Group, where applicable, should also be subject to proper supervision by a competent regulatory authority.\nAlternatively, where a PFP Applicant does not have an established track-record of at least five years or meet the regulatory status requirement, the FSRA may take into account (i) the track record of the PFP Applicant’s Controllers/substantial shareholders and (ii) the experience and qualifications of the PFP Applicant’s key individuals, when assessing the application.\n(c)\tGoverning Body\n(i)\tLicensed Directors – A PFP Applicant which is a Body Corporate incorporated in the ADGM, must register all its Directors with the FSRA in accordance with GEN Rule 5.5.4.\n(ii)\tLicensed Partners – A PFP Applicant which is Partnership established in the ADGM, must register all its Partners with the FSRA in accordance with GEN Rule 5.5.5.\nThese appointments are not required for PFP Applicants that are branches of legal entities domiciled outside the ADGM.\nThe PFP Applicant must demonstrate that its Governing Body has sufficient collective skills and experience in corporate finance or related fields to oversee the firm’s operations.\n(d)\tMandatory Appointments\nA PFP Applicant must also appoint the following individuals in accordance with GEN Rule 5.5.1:\n(i)\tSenior Executive Officer (“SEO”) – an SEO who is ultimately responsible for the day-to-day operation, supervision and control of the firm’s operation. The SEO must possess a minimum of five years’ relevant and demonstrable experience and qualifications.\n(ii)\tFinance Officer (“FO”) – a Finance Officer with the relevant expertise to prepare and oversee its financial reporting.\n(iii)\tCompliance Officer (“CO”) – a suitably experienced and qualified Compliance Officer who is independent of the firm’s operations and oversees the compliance function.\n(iv)\tMoney Laundering Reporting Officer (“MLRO”) – a suitably experienced and qualified MLRO who is independent of the firm’s operations and responsible for the implementation of the firm’s anti-money laundering controls and the day-to-day oversight of its compliance with the Anti- Money Laundering and Sanctions Rules (AML) and Guidance.\nOther considerations for PFP Applicants:\n(i)\tThe SEO, CO and MLRO must all be resident in the UAE;\n(ii)\tThe CO and MLRO functions may be carried out by the same individual; and\n(iii)\tThe FO, CO and MLRO may be carried out in-house or outsourced to another Group entity or service provider.\nThe FSRA will consider the collective suitability of all of the PFP Applicant’s proposed staff and whether there is a sufficient range of individuals with appropriate knowledge, skills and experience to understand, operate and manage the firm's affairs in a sound and prudent manner.\n(e)\tSystems and Controls\nThe FSRA will assess the following governance and control requirements in relation to the PFP Applicant.\n\\Table Start\nRequirement\tRule(s)\tNote\nRisk Management\tGEN 3.3.4 – 3.3.6\tA PFP Operator must establish and maintain risk management systems and controls to enable it to identify, assess, monitor, mitigate and control its risks.\nThis framework should include measures to minimise technology risks associated with the PFP. In particular, a PFP Operator should have measures in place to ensure data integrity and the protection of its technology from fraud, impairment, tampering, misuse or unauthorised access.\nCompliance Arrangements\tGEN 3.3.7 – 3.3.12\tA PFP Operator must establish and maintain compliance arrangements, including processes and procedures that ensure and evidence, as far as reasonably practicable, that it complies with all Regulations and Rules.\nWhile compliance support may be provided by a related entity and/or third party service providers, the ultimate responsibility for compliance with applicable laws and regulations lies with PFP Operator’s SEO and Governing Body.\nThe PFP operator is required as part of customer due diligence to assess whether the Client has the relevant knowledge or experience to understand the risks and features of the Exempt Offer.\nInternal audit\tGEN 3.3.13 – 3.3.15\tA PFP Operator’s internal audit arrangements should be appropriate to the scale, nature and complexity of its operations.\nThe internal audit may be conducted by the internal audit function within the PFP Operator, its Group’s internal audit function or outsourced to a third party service provider.\nMultilateral Trading Facility\tCOBS 8.2.2\tA MTF Operator that provides trading of Securities offered by way of an Exempt Offer on its platform, must ensure that it has effective systems and controls in place to:\n(i)\tAdmit only Securities of Exempt Offers that are made on its own platform or other platforms approved by FSRA;\n(ii)\tidentify those Persons to whom the Exempt Offer was made;\n(iii)\tcomply with MIR 3.9.1 (Admission to trading), as applicable in relation to the relevant Securities;\n(iv) \tcomply with MIR 2.8.3 in relation to Clients permitted to trade on the MTF; and\n(iv)\tallow users of its market to obtain Inside Information, including any Offer documents. relevant to the Securities.\nConflicts of Interest \tGEN 2.2.7 & 3.3.21 – 3.3.24\tA PFP  Operator  must  have  arrangements  in place ensure that conflicts of interest between itself and its Customers, between its Employees and Customers, and between one Customer and another are identified and prevented or managed or disclosed, in such a way that the interests of a Customer are not adversely affected.\n\\Table End\n(f)\tCapital Requirements\nA PFP Operator will fall within Prudential Category 4. As set out in PRU Chapter 3, a PFP Operator must maintain at all times Capital Resources in excess of its Capital Requirement, which is the higher of its Base Capital Requirement or Expenditure-Based Capital Minimum.\nThe table below sets out the Capital Requirement for PFP Operators:\n\\Table Start\nClient Asset Arrangements\tBase Capital Requirement (USD)\tExpenditure Based Capital Minimum\nPFP Operator does not hold or control Client Assets\t10,000\t6/52 x AAE\nPFP Operator holds or controls Clients Assets\t150,000\t18/52 X AAE\n(g)\tProfessional Indemnity Insurance (“PII”)\nIn accordance with PRU Rule 6.12, a PFP Operator must maintain PII cover appropriate to the nature, size, scale and risk profile of its business.\n\\Table End", "document_id": 35, "passage_id": "4.4"}, {"pid": "e4b331b0-8437-43a6-8fa7-a77f476e8c3a", "text": "MARKETS RULES – LISTING RULES\nAs set out earlier in paragraph 5, it is the FSRA’s general expectation that its Regulations (FSMR) and Rules be read as written, including in relation to the Listing Rules (Chapter 2 of MKT).

The FSRA requires Accepted Spot Commodity storage and delivery mechanisms to adhere to appropriate standards, including alignment with IOSCO’s Good and Sound Practices , with particular regard for oversight, transparency, conflicts of interest, fees and incentives and operations.\n\nFungibility\n\n(COBS Rule 22.2.2(c))\nThe FSRA requires Accepted Spot Commodities to be able to be delivered and be freely replaceable by another of a similar nature or kind for the purposes of the relevant contract (or is normally regarded as such in the Spot Commodities market), the two goods will be fungible in nature for these purposes.\n\nSanctions and Anti Money Laundering\n\n(AML and COBS Rule 22.2.2(c))\nThe FSRA requires Accepted Spot Commodities to have had appropriate due diligence and controls relating to Sanctions and Anti Money Laundering in relation to any delivery in accordance with applicable laws.\n\nDelivery Jurisdiction\n\n(COBS Rule 22.2.2(c))\nThe FSRA requires Accepted Spot Commodities to be delivered in jurisdictions where the storage or delivery facility operates under rules and regulations deemed, by the FSRA, to have equivalent standards as with those of Abu Dhabi Global Market and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nSpot Commodities that are produced, processed, stored, delivered, owned, financed or otherwise associated with jurisdictions that are subject to international or regional sanctions, as well as jurisdictions considered as having strategic Anti Money Laundering and Financial Crime deficiencies, will not be permitted.\n\nThe FSRA may also recognise, for all requirements set out in this paragraph 26, where a Spot Commodity, or Spot Commodity Activities generally, are regulated by an IOSCO Member.\n\n/Table End", "document_id": 34, "passage_id": "26)"}, {"pid": "671212e1-fc64-428d-8f65-b59a89dcbd00", "text": "REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS - SPOT COMMODITY ACTIVITIES\nSpot Commodities and Accepted Spot Commodities\nA Spot Commodity that meets the FSRA’s requirements, as demonstrated by an individual Authorised Person, will constitute an Accepted Spot Commodity for that individual Authorised Person’s activities only.

Given the limited level of industry oversight and licencing requirements, cash transactions have the potential to provide criminal groups with a continuous supply of untraceable Spot Commodities from various sources.  Furthermore, this supply can be purchased at below market cost, directly from market participants who do not have to prove how they own the Spot Commodity.  The high-volume of transactions conducted through these cash-intensive businesses can be easily falsified or co-mingled with the proceeds of crime, while the purchased Spot Commodity (such as gold) can be used to make untraceable settlements for illicit goods and services.  Due to a significant number of Spot Commodities purchases being conducted in cash, large numbers of transactions are undertaken anonymously;\n\nb)\tThe majority of ML offences relating to commodity markets are associated with international trading, with it being easy to physically convert some Spot Commodities into different forms, in order to conceal from, or understate to, border authorities the value on the shipping documentation, such as bills of lading;\n\nc)\tThe exact amount of Spot Commodities activity is difficult to identify, as smuggling is an ideal method of moving it from one location to the next, either domestically or to international jurisdictions, where it can then be converted for use on secondary markets.  Criminals may recruit couriers to move commodities across borders both legally and illegally.  This allows criminals to remain anonymous and distance themselves from a transfer;\n\nd)\tDue to the nature of Spot Commodity markets, the Spot Commodity itself does not have to exist, or be moved physically, to be traded.  Rather, citing the Spot Commodity as the traded good on an invoice can be used to justify large movements of money, either domestically or across borders; and\n\ne)\tComponents of Spot Commodity production, such as refining, smelting or shipping, may be located in jurisdictions that do not have adequate ML/TF controls.", "document_id": 34, "passage_id": "59)"}, {"pid": "30934926-5caf-4fee-aa66-a7c52d66bf12", "text": "REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS - SPOT COMMODITY ACTIVITIES\nRIEs operating an MTF or OTF using Accepted Spot Commodities\nIn interpreting COBS Rule 8.2(c), and given the current lack of global regulation of Spot Commodity intermediaries, MTFs or OTFs are permitted to only operate a ‘Membership’ model in accordance with MIR Rule 2.8.

Such an arrangement includes scenarios where an MTF provides its own in-house proprietary wallet for Clients to store any Accepted Virtual Assets bought through that exchange or transferred into the wallet from other sources. Type 1 also includes firms who solely provide the dedicated service of helping Clients (such as MTFs, broker-dealers, traders, fund / asset managers) custodise their Accepted Virtual Assets. The Type 1 custody provider effectively holds Virtual Assets (e.g., the private keys) as an agent on behalf of Clients and has control over these Accepted Virtual Assets.\n\nb)\tType 2 (Outsourced Custodial Wallet): The Authorised Person is wholly responsible for the custody of a Client’s Accepted Virtual Assets but operationally outsources this function to a third-party Virtual Asset custodian. Type 2 arrangements include the scenario where an MTF uses a third party custody service provider to hold its Clients’ Accepted Virtual Assets.\n\nc)\tType 3 (Non-Custodial / Self-Custody Wallet): The Authorised Person allows/requires Clients to wholly “self-custodise” their Accepted Virtual Assets, and at no point does the Authorised Person have partial or full control over these Clients’ Virtual Assets. The Type 3 custody provider is typically a third-party hardware or software company that offers the means for each Client to hold their Virtual Assets (and fully control private keys) themselves. Hardware wallets, mobile wallets, desktop wallets and paper wallets are generally examples of non-custodial wallets.

[#P:56e2cb44-f613-4f2a-bd4c-8726a79a5776] The calculation of E* requires adjusting both the exposure amount and the collateral value to account for potential future market fluctuations, using methods and haircuts detailed in Appendix 4. [#P:2680d877-e922-4ecb-8fc1-60f4b4c13314] The specific formula for E* depends on whether the SFT is covered by a qualifying bilateral or cross-product Netting agreement. For SFTs covered by such agreements (excluding OTC Derivatives and long settlement transactions), E* is calculated using a formula involving the fair value of the exposure (E), the fair value of eligible financial collateral (C), and an add-on amount for market and foreign exchange volatility. [#P:dcbb270d-c9cc-4b97-840b-71ad5f53c4fa] If the SFT is not covered by a qualifying Netting agreement, E* is calculated using a different formula that incorporates haircuts for the exposure (HE) and the collateral (HC), as well as a haircut for currency mismatch (HFX).

[#P:cf88cf6e-8083-4aed-8468-eed8d367f412] This calculation is applicable to SFTs where the pre-settlement counterparty exposure is determined in accordance with Rule 4.9.15. [#P:b2a0076b-8f51-4fc4-ac5b-6df2d25c4778] The FCCA approach requires adjusting both the exposure amount and the collateral value to account for potential future fluctuations due to market movements, using specified methods and haircuts. [#P:2680d877-e922-4ecb-8fc1-60f4b4c13314] The specific formula for E* depends on whether the SFT is covered by a qualifying bilateral netting agreement. For SFTs not covered by such an agreement, E* is calculated using the formula E* = max {0, [E(1 + HE) - C(1 – HC – HFX)]}, where E is the fair value of the exposure, HE is the haircut for the exposure, C is the fair value of the collateral, HC is the haircut for the collateral, and HFX is the haircut for currency mismatch. [#P:bfe1d138-bbe5-4cfd-b804-a89cccbf6949] If the SFT is covered by a qualifying bilateral netting agreement, E* is calculated using a different formula that includes an add-on amount to reflect market and foreign exchange volatility.
