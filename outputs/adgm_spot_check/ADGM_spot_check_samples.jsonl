The decision-making process involves evaluating the nature and seriousness of the contravention, its impact on customers, and any potential damage to the reputation of the ADGM. Additionally, the Regulator will assess whether the contravention has increased the risk of financial crime within a firm, Recognised Body, or Reporting Entity. The Regulator also considers any remedial actions taken by the auditor or actuary, as well as any disciplinary measures imposed by relevant professional bodies. The auditor's or actuary's previous compliance record and any past disciplinary sanctions are also taken into account.

{"persona": "Professional", "question": "What capital must a Recognised Investment Exchange hold, and how does this relate to the regulatory capital requirements for an Authorised Person operating as an MTF or OTF?", "answer": "A Recognised Investment Exchange is required to maintain capital equivalent to six months of operational expenses. Additionally, unless directed otherwise by the Regulator, it must hold an extra buffer of up to another six months' operational expenses. This requirement aligns with the regulatory capital obligations for an Authorised Person operating as a Multilateral Trading Facility (MTF) or Organised Trading Facility (OTF), where the capital to be held is also equivalent to six months of operational expenses. This consistency ensures that both Recognised Investment Exchanges and Authorised Persons operating as MTFs or OTFs maintain a robust financial position to support their operational activities and meet regulatory expectations. The alignment of these requirements underscores the importance of maintaining sufficient capital to cover potential operational risks and ensures a stable financial environment within the regulatory framework [#SRC:59dfe046-0591-4dc2-a1d3-f4b1d56e6ee8] and [#TGT:1f2f00c6-1680-4516-adc8-b360f33ebe96].", "source_passage_id": "59dfe046-0591-4dc2-a1d3-f4b1d56e6ee8", "target_passage_id": "1f2f00c6-1680-4516-adc8-b360f33ebe96", "source_passage_text": "REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS - SPOT COMMODITY ACTIVITIES Capital Requirements The FSRA applies the regulatory capital requirements in COBS Rule 22.10 in two different scenarios, such that: a) where the Authorised Person is an MTF or OTF, the regulatory capital to be held (under COBS Rule 22.10.1(a) and MIR Rule 3.2.1) is equivalent to 6 months operational expenses ; and b) in relation to all other Authorised Persons, the conventional regulatory capital requirements applicable to the Regulated Activities undertaken apply.", "target_passage_text": "A Recognised Investment Exchange shall hold the following capital: (a) an amount equal to 6 months' operational expenses; plus (b) unless the Regulator directs otherwise, an additional buffer amount of up to a further 6 months' operational expenses.", "reference_text": "3.2.1", "reference_type": "External", "generator_model": "gpt-4o", "pipeline_version": "SCHEMA_v1.1", "created_at": "2025-11-23", "judge_passed": true, "judge_final_score": 9, "judge_subscores": {"realism": 2, "dual_use": 4, "correctness": 4}, "judge_fused": {"passed": true, "final_score": 9, "subscores": {"realism": 2, "dual_use": 4, "correctness": 4}, "reasons": ["fused_median_scores_over_ensemble"], "ensemble": {"n": 3}}, "judge_per_judge": [{"model": "gpt-4.1-mini", "seed": 13, "tag": "gpt-4.1-mini@seed:13", "result": {"passed": true, "final_score": 9, "subscores": {"realism": 2, "dual_use": 3, "correctness": 4}, "reasons": ["Question is naturally phrased and relevant to compliance context.", "Answer requires both SOURCE and TARGET to fully address the capital requirements and their relation.", "Answer correctly states the capital requirements for Recognised Investment Exchanges and relates them to those for Authorised Persons operating as MTF or OTF, fully grounded in the texts."], "flags": {"hard_gate_fail": false, "question_has_citation": false}}}, {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "seed": 13, "tag": "gpt-4o-mini@seed:13", "result": {"passed": false, "final_score": 0, "subscores": {"realism": 2, "dual_use": 4, "correctness": 4}, "reasons": ["The question is realistic and natural for compliance.", "The question requires both passages to answer correctly, as it involves specific capital requirements from both the SOURCE and TARGET.", "The answer is correct and accurately reflects the information from both passages."], "flags": {"hard_gate_fail": true, "question_has_citation": true}}}, {"model": "gpt-4.1-mini", "seed": 17, "tag": "gpt-4.1-mini@seed:17", "result": {"passed": true, "final_score": 9, "subscores": {"realism": 2, "dual_use": 4, "correctness": 3}, "reasons": ["Question is clearly realistic and naturally phrased for compliance context.", "Answer requires both SOURCE and TARGET to fully address the capital requirements and their relation; removing either would lose key information.", "Answer is mostly correct and grounded; it accurately states the capital requirements for Recognised Investment Exchanges and the equivalence for Authorised Persons as MTF/OTF, but slightly overstates the 'alignment' as exact equivalence since the buffer is conditional."], "flags": {"hard_gate_fail": false, "question_has_citation": false}}}], "ir_agreement": {"num_rel": 2, "num_methods_hit_any": 3, "num_methods_hit_all": 0, "high_concordance_any": false, "low_concordance_any": false, "k": 10, "methods": {"bge.txt": {"rel_in_topk": 1, "hit_any": true, "hit_all": false, "first_hit_rank": 5}, "bm25.txt": {"rel_in_topk": 1, "hit_any": true, "hit_all": false, "first_hit_rank": 4}, "bm25_e5_rerank.txt": {"rel_in_topk": 0, "hit_any": false, "hit_all": false, "first_hit_rank": null}, "e5.txt": {"rel_in_topk": 0, "hit_any": false, "hit_all": false, "first_hit_rank": null}, "hybrid_rrf_bm25_e5.txt": {"rel_in_topk": 1, "hit_any": true, "hit_all": false, "first_hit_rank": 3}}}, "id": "SCHEMA_000642", "method": "SCHEMA", "split": "train", "adgm_spot_check_id": "ADGM_SCHEMA_40"}
