The JORC Code, SAMREC Code, and NI 43-101 set out specific requirements for the classification and disclosure of Ore Reserves, which include the need to provide detailed information on the economic viability of the reserves. This involves adhering to the guidelines and definitions provided by these Mining Reporting Standards, which are designed to ensure consistency and transparency in reporting. The FSRA, as the Listing Authority within the ADGM, requires that disclosures are made in accordance with these standards to the extent practicable, ensuring that any economic assumptions used in financial forecasts are consistent with the standards' requirements for Ore Reserves classification. If there are any inconsistencies between the Mining Reporting Standards and the FSMR or MKT, the latter will prevail, but this does not permit the omission of any requirements set by the Mining Reporting Standards unless explicitly stated otherwise. Therefore, Mining Reporting Entities must carefully align their financial disclosures with the economic assumptions and classification criteria outlined in the JORC, SAMREC, and NI 43-101 Codes.
