However, communications that fall under the category of Exempt Communications, such as those related to trading on a Recognised Investment Exchange or for compliance with ongoing reporting requirements, are excluded from this definition and thus do not require a Prospectus [#P:0b2b84b1-eea1-4dc0-a5b7-70b68bc88ad4] [#P:35fa228f-ac9c-4d5f-82af-61d001921310].
