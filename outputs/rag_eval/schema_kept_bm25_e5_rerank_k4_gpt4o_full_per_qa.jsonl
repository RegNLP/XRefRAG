According to the FSMR, these communications do not trigger the Prospectus requirements typically associated with Offers of Securities. This exclusion is crucial as it delineates the boundary between communications that must comply with Prospectus obligations and those that are exempt. The definition of an Offer of Securities involves any communication that presents information on the terms of the offer and the securities, enabling an investor to decide on purchasing or subscribing to those securities. However, certain communications, such as those related to trading on a Recognised Investment Exchange or those made for regulatory reporting purposes, are explicitly excluded from being classified as Offers of Securities. Therefore, Exempt Communications, by not being considered Offers, do not attract the regulatory burden of preparing a Prospectus, streamlining certain communications within the financial markets as permitted [#SRC:0b2b84b1-eea1-4dc0-a5b7-70b68bc88ad4] and required [#TGT:35fa228f-ac9c-4d5f-82af-61d001921310].", "rag_answer": "Exempt Communications are not considered Offers of Securities under section 59(c) of the FSMR, which means they do not trigger the Prospectus requirements outlined in the FSMR and associated Rules.

First, they must apply the same procedures as outlined in Rules 4.14.59 to 4.14.61.

The conversion factors are found in a table that shows different percentages based on how much the excess spread is compared to the trapping point. For example, if the excess spread is at least 133.33% of the trapping point, the CCF is 0%, but it becomes 100% if it is less than 50% of the trapping point.

Transactions are not allowed if they aren't for real reasons and don't follow Accepted Market Practices.

At the same time, the Regulator has the power to declare any investment, even if it's not normally a Security, as a Security through a written notice.

The FSRA evaluates whether the economic and legal features of the tokens align with those of conventional Securities. If deemed Digital Securities, the tokens are subject to the same regulatory framework as traditional Securities. Issuers planning an ICO in or from ADGM should engage with the FSRA early in the process to determine the regulatory status of their tokens. Additionally, market intermediaries and operators dealing with Digital Securities must be approved by the FSRA as Financial Services Permission holders or recognized entities. However, not all ICOs are considered Offers of Securities; if tokens lack the features of Securities like Shares or Debentures, they are unlikely to be classified as such, nor would their trading constitute a Regulated Activity under FSMR.
