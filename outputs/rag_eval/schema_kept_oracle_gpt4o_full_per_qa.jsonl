An Offer of Securities is any communication that gives information about the offer and the securities, allowing an investor to decide to buy or subscribe. However, some communications, like those related to trading on a Recognised Investment Exchange or for regulatory reporting, are not seen as Offers of Securities. Because Exempt Communications are not considered Offers, they do not have to deal with the Prospectus requirements, making it easier for certain communications in the financial markets to proceed without extra regulatory steps as required [#TGT:35fa228f-ac9c-4d5f-82af-61d001921310] and permitted [#SRC:0b2b84b1-eea1-4dc0-a5b7-70b68bc88ad4].", "rag_answer": "Exempt Communications are not considered Offers of Securities under section 59(c) of the FSMR, which means they do not trigger the Prospectus requirements typically associated with such offers. This exemption applies when the communication does not present information in a manner that enables an investor to decide to buy or subscribe to the Securities, or when it falls under specific categories such as communications related to trading on a Recognised Investment Exchange, compliance with ongoing reporting requirements, or other communications prescribed as exempt in the Rules [#P:0b2b84b1-eea1-4dc0-a5b7-70b68bc88ad4][#P:35fa228f-ac9c-4d5f-82af-61d001921310].

This approach ensures that while the Guidance aids in understanding the regulatory framework, it does not carry the force of law, thus maintaining its non-binding nature. The issuance of Guidance under section 15(2) of the FSMR underscores its role in facilitating compliance and understanding within the financial services sector, while not constraining the regulated entities with additional binding obligations [#SRC:21eef1b0-cc53-4b57-bc5b-7aabd21ef37f] [#TGT:9cba1e46-74c9-4276-9e69-6ed8746e30dd].", "rag_answer": "Guidance issued under the Financial Services and Markets Regulations (FSMR) is indicative and non-binding, serving as a supplementary tool to aid in the understanding and application of the FSMR and the Market Rules (MKT) of the Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA) [#P:21eef1b0-cc53-4b57-bc5b-7aabd21ef37f].
