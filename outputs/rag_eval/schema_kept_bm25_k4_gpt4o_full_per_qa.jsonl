This involves using Rule A4.6.14 to determine the Credit RWA and applying the correct Credit Risk Weight (CRW) for the corporate asset class of the Non-QCCP. The risk weights for the corporate asset class depend on the credit quality grade of the exposure. The risk weights are specified in a table, with percentages ranging from 20% for the highest credit quality grade to 150% for lower grades, and a 100% risk weight for unrated exposures.

For the corporate asset class, if a CR Exposure does not have an external credit assessment by a recognised external credit rating agency, the risk weight must be the higher of the risk weight determined by the table under Rule 4.12.13 or the risk weight applicable to a CR Exposure to the central government of the jurisdiction where the corporate is incorporated [#P:f80ad0a8-f280-43e0-a71b-74b00c8175ad]. Additionally, for short-term CR Exposures with an issue-specific external credit assessment, the risk weights are determined by the credit quality grade: 20% for Grade I, 50% for Grade II, 100% for Grade III, and 150% for Grade IV [#P:f7236c23-bc27-4e82-8b92-53c784b2a98a].
