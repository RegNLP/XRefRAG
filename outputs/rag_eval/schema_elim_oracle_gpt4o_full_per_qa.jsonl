The rule restricts a Listed Entity from issuing or agreeing to issue more Equity Securities than a calculated maximum without the approval of the holders of Ordinary Securities. The maximum number of Equity Securities that can be issued is determined by the formula: (20% * Base Amount) – Relevant Issues. The Base Amount includes the number of fully paid Ordinary Securities on issue 12 months prior to the date of issue or agreement, plus additional fully paid Ordinary Securities issued under certain exceptions in Rule 9.7.4, excluding exceptions (8), (15), or (16), and other specified conditions. Relevant Issues are the number of Equity Securities issued in the 12 months before the date of issue or agreement, excluding those issued with approval under Rule 9.7.1 or Rule 9.7.5, or under an exception in Rule 9.7.4. Therefore, a Listed Entity must ensure compliance with these calculations and seek necessary approvals unless an exception applies.

The key precondition for this exclusion is that the firm must be authorised to manage an unrestricted PSIAu, and the calculation must be in accordance with the IFR rules. The procedure requires the firm to assess the total of the Profit Equalisation Reserve and the Investment Risk Reserve and compare it to the Displaced Commercial Risk Capital Requirement.
