A request is considered complex or novel if it involves intricate applications due to the applicant's start-up profile, origin, ownership structure, or business model, or if it necessitates intense supervisory scrutiny from a risk perspective. Additionally, complex restructurings, changes in an authorized person's or recognized body's structure or activities, and waiver or modification requests that are particularly complex or novel also qualify. Novel proposals that cover untested areas of the financial services regulatory regime or complex business models requiring significant additional expenses for supervision are also included. Furthermore, if the Controller is from a jurisdiction lacking an adequate memorandum of understanding with the Regulator, or if the Controller proposes significant changes to the business model, activities, or senior management, a supplementary fee may be charged.

First, they must apply the same procedures as outlined in Rules 4.14.59 to 4.14.61, which involve determining the appropriate segments and applying the corresponding conversion factors. The key factors include the investors' interest and the conversion factors based on the Excess Spread level relative to the transaction's Excess Spread trapping point. For retail credit lines, the conversion factors vary depending on the percentage of the trapping point, ranging from 0% for 133.33% or more of the trapping point to 100% for less than 50% of the trapping point. For non-retail credit lines, a consistent conversion factor of 100% is applied regardless of the trapping point percentage. These conversion factors are crucial in determining the Credit RWA amounts as they directly influence the risk weight applied to the investors' interest. It is essential for the Authorised Person to accurately assess these factors to ensure compliance with the regulatory requirements.
