After determining the value, the Exposure must be categorised according to certain rules. This step is important because it sets the stage for assigning a Credit Quality Grade and the right risk weight to each Exposure. The categorisation is essential because it influences the risk weight, which in turn affects the RWA calculation.

Additionally, the Regulator assesses the market fundamentals, such as market practice, liquidity, demand and supply dynamics, participant activity, transparency, and the fair and orderly operation of the market. These considerations are essential to ensure that the Spot Commodity is appropriate for the Authorised Person's Regulated Activity. The definition of a Spot Commodity, as clarified by the FSRA, includes goods sold for cash and promptly delivered, excluding futures, financial instruments, services, or intangible items.

First, they check if the Authorised Person follows responsible and sustainable sourcing standards, which should match international certification standards for that commodity. They also look at the market's basics, like how the market operates, its liquidity, the number of active participants, and how transparent and fair the market is. These checks help ensure the Spot Commodity is suitable for the Authorised Person's regulated activities. A Spot Commodity, as defined by the FSRA, is a good sold for cash and delivered quickly, not a future contract, financial instrument, or intangible item.

To assess if a Spot Commodity meets the criteria for being an Accepted Spot Commodity, the Regulator considers: (a) the Authorised Person’s adherence to responsible and sustainable sourcing standards, including internationally recognized certifications; (b) the market fundamentals such as market practice, liquidity, participant activity, transparency, and orderly operation; and (c) any other relevant factors deemed necessary by the Regulator [#P:2a87b251-49cc-4d23-b88b-e73df61b7338].

This requirement aligns with the regulatory capital obligations for an Authorised Person operating as a Multilateral Trading Facility (MTF) or Organised Trading Facility (OTF), where the capital to be held is also equivalent to six months of operational expenses. This consistency ensures that both Recognised Investment Exchanges and Authorised Persons operating as MTFs or OTFs maintain a robust financial position to support their operational activities and meet regulatory expectations.
