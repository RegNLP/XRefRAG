According to the FSMR, these communications do not trigger the Prospectus requirements typically associated with Offers of Securities. This exclusion is crucial as it delineates the boundary between communications that must comply with Prospectus obligations and those that are exempt. The definition of an Offer of Securities involves any communication that presents information on the terms of the offer and the securities, enabling an investor to decide on purchasing or subscribing to those securities. However, certain communications, such as those related to trading on a Recognised Investment Exchange or those made for regulatory reporting purposes, are explicitly excluded from being classified as Offers of Securities. Therefore, Exempt Communications, by not being considered Offers, do not attract the regulatory burden of preparing a Prospectus, streamlining certain communications within the financial markets as permitted [#SRC:0b2b84b1-eea1-4dc0-a5b7-70b68bc88ad4] and required [#TGT:35fa228f-ac9c-4d5f-82af-61d001921310].", "rag_answer": "Exempt Communications are not considered Offers of Securities under section 59(c) of the FSMR, which means they do not trigger the Prospectus requirements outlined in the FSMR and associated Rules.

The key precondition for this exemption is that the communication must qualify as an Exempt Communication as defined by the relevant rules.

This framework allows for certain securities and offers to bypass the usual prospectus requirements, streamlining the process for those that meet the criteria set forth by the Regulator [#SRC:63c6805e-92e4-4c6d-b742-c547b94768fe] and [#TGT:c52f671c-82a7-42f1-a7dc-13b3ae276b60].", "rag_answer": "The Regulator's power to prescribe certain types of Offers of Securities as 'Exempt Offers' or Securities as 'Exempt Securities' is applicable in situations where these designations allow for the bypassing of the requirement to produce a Prospectus.
