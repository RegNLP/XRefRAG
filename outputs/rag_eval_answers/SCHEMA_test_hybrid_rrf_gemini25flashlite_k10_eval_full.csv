2,3,"The Regulator has the authority to classify an investment that is not inherently a Security as a Security through a written notice. This action can be taken to ensure compliance with the applicable Regulations and Rules, and it is subject to any terms and conditions the Regulator deems appropriate. This capability aligns with the FSRA's procedure for assessing digital token offerings. The FSRA evaluates each offering on a case-by-case basis to determine if a digital or virtual token exhibits the characteristics of a Security. If it does, the FSRA will classify the token as a Digital Security under the relevant section of the FSMR.

5,5,"Exposures to banks with short-term credit assessments are classified within an exempt asset class, meaning they do not qualify as private sector credit exposures. This classification is based on specific regulatory provisions that exclude such bank exposures from the requirement to calculate Credit RWAs under Chapter 4. In contrast, exposures to non-bank entities with similar short-term credit assessments do not fall under this exemption and are considered private sector credit exposures. Consequently, these non-bank exposures require the calculation of Credit RWAs as they do not fit into any of the exempt asset classes, such as central government, public sector enterprises, or banks. This distinction is crucial for regulatory compliance, as it determines the necessity of calculating risk-weighted assets for different types of credit exposures [#SRC:89b3f081-9e4b-4186-8137-b2159741c31f] and [#TGT:5d947e78-d9be-42d5-aad3-95b3528ea88c].",SCHEMA_000950,0.0,0.8,"Exposures to banks with short-term credit assessments are distinguished from those to non-bank entities with similar assessments when determining private sector credit exposures, primarily due to their classification within an exempt asset class.
