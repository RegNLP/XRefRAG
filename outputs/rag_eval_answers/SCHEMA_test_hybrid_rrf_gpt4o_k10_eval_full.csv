4,5,"Exposures to banks with short-term credit assessments are classified within an exempt asset class, meaning they do not qualify as private sector credit exposures. This classification is based on specific regulatory provisions that exclude such bank exposures from the requirement to calculate Credit RWAs under Chapter 4. In contrast, exposures to non-bank entities with similar short-term credit assessments do not fall under this exemption and are considered private sector credit exposures. Consequently, these non-bank exposures require the calculation of Credit RWAs as they do not fit into any of the exempt asset classes, such as central government, public sector enterprises, or banks. This distinction is crucial for regulatory compliance, as it determines the necessity of calculating risk-weighted assets for different types of credit exposures [#SRC:89b3f081-9e4b-4186-8137-b2159741c31f] and [#TGT:5d947e78-d9be-42d5-aad3-95b3528ea88c].",SCHEMA_000950,0.0,0.7142857142857143,"Exposures to banks with short-term credit assessments are classified differently from those to non-bank entities due to the exempt asset class provisions.
