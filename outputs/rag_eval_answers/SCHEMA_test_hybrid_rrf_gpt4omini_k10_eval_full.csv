3,4,"An offer of securities does not need a prospectus if it is considered an Exempt Offer. This can happen if the offer is aimed at Professional Clients who are not natural persons, if it is made to fewer than 50 people in a year (excluding certain Professional Clients), or if the total purchase amount is at least USD 100,000. Similarly, the requirement to issue a prospectus does not apply to offers that are exempt according to the Rules. Additionally, securities that will be traded on a Recognised Investment Exchange are also exempt from needing a prospectus if they are classified as exempt Securities under the Rules. These exemptions help certain offers and securities avoid the usual prospectus requirements, making it easier to conduct specific market activities while still following regulations [#SRC:e0ab4647-3da5-4379-897b-c392a59b8ed5] and [#TGT:c52f671c-82a7-42f1-a7dc-13b3ae276b60].",SCHEMA_000039,0.0,0.2,"An offer of securities does not need a prospectus when it qualifies as an ""Exempt Offer"" or involves ""Exempt Securities.""

Additionally, Exempt Securities are defined as those that meet specific conditions, such as shares representing less than 10% of the same class already admitted to trading on a Recognised Investment Exchange, or securities offered in connection with a takeover or merger, provided that equivalent information to a prospectus is available. The obligation to issue a prospectus under section 61(3) of the FSMR does not apply in these cases, allowing for more streamlined processes in securities offerings.

3,4,"The Regulator has the authority to classify an investment that is not inherently a Security as a Security through a written notice. This action can be taken to ensure compliance with the applicable Regulations and Rules, and it is subject to any terms and conditions the Regulator deems appropriate. This capability aligns with the FSRA's procedure for assessing digital token offerings. The FSRA evaluates each offering on a case-by-case basis to determine if a digital or virtual token exhibits the characteristics of a Security. If it does, the FSRA will classify the token as a Digital Security under the relevant section of the FSMR. This dual approach ensures that investments, whether traditional or digital, are appropriately regulated to protect investors. The Regulator's discretion to reclassify investments supports the FSRA's efforts to maintain regulatory oversight and investor protection in the evolving landscape of digital securities [#SRC:ad5b9e34-f66a-4e3f-8373-a85bdc331124] and [#TGT:95497208-1e94-4b51-8ff3-d9e77f64177c].",SCHEMA_000041,0.0,0.6666666666666666,"The Regulator may deem an investment that is not initially classified as a Security to be a Security if it exhibits the economic and legal features characteristic of a Security, as defined under the Financial Services and Markets Regulations (FSMR). This assessment is conducted on a case-by-case basis by the Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA) and applies particularly to digital token offerings. To facilitate this determination, issuers must provide comprehensive information demonstrating that their proposed digital token meets the criteria of a Security. 

Key conditions and procedures include:
- Issuers must submit an Approved Prospectus to the FSRA if required, which will be used to assess whether the digital token qualifies as a Security under Section 58(2)(b) of FSMR. [#P:3]
- For Exempt Offers, the FSRA will review the relevant documentation to make a determination, although approval of the Exempt Offer itself is not required. [#P:4]

4,5,"Yes, an Authorised Person must write down its policy for using exclusions related to credit risk mitigations. This is necessary when the Authorised Person is allowed to lower the value of its Exposures.

This exemption is contingent upon the asset meeting the criteria of being considered environmentally sustainable or equivalent under an Acceptable Green Taxonomy, with the stipulation that only one Acceptable Green Taxonomy is employed by an ADGM Green Portfolio. The alignment with the EU Paris Aligned Benchmark ensures that the asset's sustainability credentials are recognized, thereby negating the need for additional attestation.

Specifically, the underlying credit risk's origin must be identified to ensure accurate rate application, as different jurisdictions may have different regulatory requirements and rates for the CCyB. This process ensures that the Authorised Person maintains adequate capital buffers in line with the risks associated with its credit exposures.

3,4,"The Regulator can tell a Reporting Entity to share information with the market when certain conditions are met. This can happen if the Reporting Entity hasn't followed the rules about sharing information under the FSMR or if there's a risk of a false market in a company's securities. For this action to help the Abu Dhabi Global Market, the Regulator must believe it's in the market's best interest. This means the Regulator's decision should support market transparency and integrity. The Regulator can also add extra rules for the Reporting Entity to follow, which can be customized based on what the Regulator thinks is needed. These actions help make sure the market stays fair and that any wrong or missing information is fixed quickly [#SRC:f416d7fa-af65-48d6-a16f-ed11a6daadac] and [#TGT:5ed7d470-9d48-4676-936b-d27b5c945a94].",SCHEMA_000942,0.2857142857142857,0.5714285714285714,"The Regulator can direct a Reporting Entity to share information with the market when it determines that such disclosure is in the interests of the Abu Dhabi Global Market.

4,5,"Exposures to banks with short-term credit assessments are classified within an exempt asset class, meaning they do not qualify as private sector credit exposures. This classification is based on specific regulatory provisions that exclude such bank exposures from the requirement to calculate Credit RWAs under Chapter 4. In contrast, exposures to non-bank entities with similar short-term credit assessments do not fall under this exemption and are considered private sector credit exposures. Consequently, these non-bank exposures require the calculation of Credit RWAs as they do not fit into any of the exempt asset classes, such as central government, public sector enterprises, or banks. This distinction is crucial for regulatory compliance, as it determines the necessity of calculating risk-weighted assets for different types of credit exposures [#SRC:89b3f081-9e4b-4186-8137-b2159741c31f] and [#TGT:5d947e78-d9be-42d5-aad3-95b3528ea88c].",SCHEMA_000950,0.0,0.6,"Exposures to banks with short-term credit assessments are classified differently from those to non-bank entities in the context of private sector credit exposures.
