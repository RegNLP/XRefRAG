However, exceptions exist for Listed Entities that meet specific criteria, such as qualifying for admission under a particular rule, having a track record of profitability or revenue deemed acceptable by the Regulator, or possessing tangible assets with a substantial and readily ascertainable value. These exceptions mean that the restrictions in certain categories of APP 7 may not apply unless the Regulator decides otherwise. This dual framework ensures that while general restrictions are in place for Applicants and Listed Entities, certain entities with proven financial stability or asset value may be exempt from these restrictions, thereby facilitating a more tailored regulatory approach [#SRC:13cf0ba8-adc8-450e-bee1-619794cc9131] and [#TGT:044c2eb2-828b-42a2-8b05-68613aed8eac].", "source_passage_id": "13cf0ba8-adc8-450e-bee1-619794cc9131", "target_passage_id": "044c2eb2-828b-42a2-8b05-68613aed8eac", "reference_type": null, "persona": "professional"}

First, they must apply the same procedures as outlined in Rules 4.14.59 to 4.14.61. This involves determining the investors' interest, using the correct credit conversion factor (CCF), and applying the risk weight for the type of exposure involved. The conversion factors are found in a table that shows different percentages based on how much the excess spread is compared to the trapping point. For example, if the excess spread is at least 133.33% of the trapping point, the CCF is 0%, but it becomes 100% if it is less than 50% of the trapping point.
