An Offer of Securities is any communication that gives information about the offer and the securities, allowing an investor to decide to buy or subscribe. However, some communications, like those related to trading on a Recognised Investment Exchange or for regulatory reporting, are not seen as Offers of Securities. Because Exempt Communications are not considered Offers, they do not have to deal with the Prospectus requirements, making it easier for certain communications in the financial markets to proceed without extra regulatory steps as required [#TGT:35fa228f-ac9c-4d5f-82af-61d001921310] and permitted [#SRC:0b2b84b1-eea1-4dc0-a5b7-70b68bc88ad4].", "debug_context": {"source_passage_id": "0b2b84b1-eea1-4dc0-a5b7-70b68bc88ad4", "target_passage_id": "35fa228f-ac9c-4d5f-82af-61d001921310", "source_text": "For the purposes of section 59(c) of the FSMR, Exempt Communications are not Offers of Securities and therefore do not attract the Prospectus requirements in the FSMR and Rules.", "target_text": "General prohibitions and definitions.
