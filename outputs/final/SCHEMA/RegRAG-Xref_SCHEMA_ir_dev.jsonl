Specifically, for operational risks, the Recognised Clearing House must calculate its capital requirement using either the Basic Indicator Approach or, with prior authorisation, the Standardised or Alternative Standardised Approach. Additionally, for credit and counterparty credit risks, the capital requirements are calculated as a percentage of risk-weighted exposure amounts, with specific risk weights applied to exposures related to other clearing houses. The business risk capital requirement must be based on an approved estimate of potential losses from adverse scenarios, subject to a minimum threshold.
