When the pre-settlement Counterparty Exposure is determined by specific rules and the SFT is under a qualifying bilateral Netting agreement using the FCCA, the Authorised Person must calculate a value called E* for all its Credit Risk (CR) Exposures to any single Counterparty covered by the agreement. This calculation must follow certain rules, especially if using supervisory haircuts or own estimate haircuts. Once calculated, E* should replace E in the calculation of the Credit Risk weighted Exposure amount for the CR Exposures to that Counterparty.

This requirement aligns with the broader obligation for Authorised Persons to manage liquidity effectively, which can be achieved through holding sufficient cash or marketable assets, securing a matching future cashflow profile, or borrowing as needed. Additionally, the Branch must comply with its Home State Regulator's prudential requirements and submit relevant capital adequacy and leverage ratio reports to the Regulator within ten business days of their due date.

This statement must detail how and why the disclosure differs from the non-mandatory requirement. This obligation aligns with the Regulator's expectation that Petroleum Reporting Entities either fully comply with all non-mandatory requirements or provide an explanation for their non-compliance.
