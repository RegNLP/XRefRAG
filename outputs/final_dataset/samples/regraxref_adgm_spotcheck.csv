The Issuer must include all needed information in the Exempt Offer document so the Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA) can classify the Digital Securities as Securities. At the same time, the Regulator has the power to decide, through a written notice, to either skip some requirements or classify any investment not originally seen as a Security to be a Security. This decision is made under conditions the Regulator thinks are right.

SCHEMA_000297,"How does the Regulator decide if a Spot Commodity can be an Accepted Spot Commodity, and what does a Spot Commodity mean?","The Regulator decides if a Spot Commodity can be an Accepted Spot Commodity by looking at several important factors. First, they check if the Authorised Person follows responsible and sustainable sourcing standards, which should match international certification standards for that commodity. They also look at the market's basics, like how the market operates, its liquidity, the number of active participants, and how transparent and fair the market is. These checks help ensure the Spot Commodity is suitable for the Authorised Person's regulated activities. A Spot Commodity, as defined by the FSRA, is a good sold for cash and delivered quickly, not a future contract, financial instrument, or intangible item. This definition helps the Regulator make sure only the right types of commodities are considered for acceptance, fitting the rules for Spot Commodity activities [#SRC:34ccda9d-76c5-45f3-af56-56834f25f068] and [#TGT:2a87b251-49cc-4d23-b88b-e73df61b7338].","REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS - SPOT COMMODITY ACTIVITIES Spot Commodities and Accepted Spot Commodities For clarification, the FSRA considers that a Spot Commodity is: a) a good sold for cash and promptly delivered when the transaction is settled; b) not a contract for the sale of a commodity under which delivery is to be made at a future date, other than the period generally accepted in the market for that Spot Commodity as the standard delivery period (it is therefore not considered a Future); c) not a Financial Instrument involving conventional assets (e.g., Securities or Derivatives); d) not a service or other items that are not goods, such as currencies or rights in real estate, or that are intangible; and e) an Environmental Instrument , where deemed by the Regulator to be a carbon offset for the purposes of section 258 of FSMR (see Rule COBS 22.2.2(d)).","For the purposes of determining whether in its opinion, a Spot Commodity meets the requirements of being an Accepted Spot Commodity, the Regulator will consider – (a) the Authorised Person’s requirements for, and standards used, in relation to responsible and sustainable sourcing, including adherence to internationally recognised certification standards, as applicable, to the relevant Spot Commodity (as set out in Rule 22.3); (b) the market fundamentals in respect of the relevant Spot Commodity’s market, including - (i) its market practice and characteristics; (ii) its liquidity, and depth and breadth of demand and supply; (iii) the number of active participants; (iv) market transparency; and (v) its fair and orderly operation; and (c) any other factors that, in the opinion of the Regulator, are to be taken into account in determining whether or not a Spot Commodity is appropriate for the purpose of the Authorised Person conducting a Regulated Activity in relation to a Spot Commodity.",SCHEMA,train,Basic,External,34ccda9d-76c5-45f3-af56-56834f25f068,2a87b251-49cc-4d23-b88b-e73df61b7338,34,3,Guidance - Regulation of Spot Commodities Activities in ADGM,23),CoBs,22.2.2

This is important because it shows which communications do not have to meet the usual requirements for Offers of Securities. An Offer of Securities is any communication that gives information about the offer and the securities, allowing an investor to decide to buy or subscribe. However, some communications, like those related to trading on a Recognised Investment Exchange or for regulatory reporting, are not seen as Offers of Securities. Because Exempt Communications are not considered Offers, they do not have to deal with the Prospectus requirements, making it easier for certain communications in the financial markets to proceed without extra regulatory steps as required [#TGT:35fa228f-ac9c-4d5f-82af-61d001921310] and permitted [#SRC:0b2b84b1-eea1-4dc0-a5b7-70b68bc88ad4].","For the purposes of section 59(c) of the FSMR, Exempt Communications are not Offers of Securities and therefore do not attract the Prospectus requirements in the FSMR and Rules.","General prohibitions and definitions.

This decision is made on a case-by-case basis, and issuers should contact the FSRA early if they plan to launch an ICO in or from ADGM. This process is part of the FSRA's role in regulating ICOs under the FSMR. At the same time, the Regulator has the power to declare any investment, even if it's not normally a Security, as a Security through a written notice. This means the Regulator can apply or remove certain rules as needed. The FSRA's decision to classify tokens as Digital Securities works with the Regulator's broader power to make sure investments are properly regulated. This helps keep the market fair and protects investors.

This obligation ensures that the RIE operates under the appropriate regulatory framework. However, a Recognised Investment Exchange may continue to carry on the Regulated Activity of operating a Multilateral Trading Facility (MTF) or an Organised Trading Facility (OTF) if its Recognition Order explicitly includes a stipulation permitting such activities. This stipulation is crucial as it allows the RIE to maintain its operations in these areas, provided the Recognition Order accounts for it. The specific rules governing MTFs and OTFs, as outlined in the Conduct of Business Standards (COBS), will apply to these functions, ensuring compliance with regulatory standards. Therefore, while relinquishing the Financial Services Permission is mandatory upon obtaining the Recognition Order, the continued operation of an MTF or OTF is contingent upon the inclusion of the necessary stipulation in the Recognition Order [#SRC:d27a9a5d-f443-4ca1-a549-8316b911bfe7] and [#TGT:8e498a69-8f0c-44c3-970c-58d870656388].","REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS - SPOT COMMODITY ACTIVITIES RIEs operating an MTF or OTF using Accepted Spot Commodities Authorised Persons that are operating an MTF or OTF wishing to also operate a RIE will be required to relinquish their FSP upon obtaining a Recognition Order (to operate the RIE).

This implies that while the procedures to detect and deal with the failure of a Member or participant to settle are crucial, the inability to settle a specific transaction does not automatically result in non-compliance. The regulatory framework considers various aspects such as rules and practices for clearing and settlement, arrangements for matching trades, and procedures for monitoring settlement performance. However, the emphasis is on the overall arrangements and procedures rather than the outcome of individual transactions.

In the context of delegation and outsourcing, this means that while the general chapter does not apply to Fund Managers, they are still subject to the detailed requirements of Appendix A1. This appendix mandates that Fund Managers, along with Trustees if appointed, must comply with specific provisions when entering into delegation and outsourcing agreements.

SCHEMA_000625,"Under what conditions may the Regulator vary or revoke a Prohibition Order, and what procedural steps must an individual follow to apply for such a change?","The Regulator may vary or revoke a Prohibition Order upon receiving an application from the individual named in the order. This action is discretionary and depends on the Regulator's assessment of all relevant circumstances. The individual must apply under the specified section of the FSMR to initiate this process. The Regulator does not usually impose a fixed duration for a Prohibition Order, as it is challenging to determine when an individual will become fit and proper again. Therefore, the application process is crucial for individuals seeking to alter the terms of their Prohibition Order. The Regulator's decision to vary or revoke the order will consider the individual's current fitness and propriety, among other factors, to ensure that the decision aligns with regulatory standards and public interest [#TGT:036cada9-f050-4c36-9c6c-bb8b3e741a75] and is permitted under the procedural guidelines [#SRC:5524af9d-0063-44a7-b9fd-5fd1d6bced7b].","When imposing a Prohibition Order, we do not usually specify that it will remain in force for a specified period.
