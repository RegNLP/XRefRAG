1,DPEL,"The question requires both passages to answer correctly, as it involves interpreting references and additional requirements."
1,DPEL,Answer requires both SOURCE (interpretation of Financial Instruments as Virtual Assets) and TARGET (additional MIR rulebook requirements for MTF/OTF Operators) to be fully correct
1,DPEL,"The question requires both passages to answer correctly, as it involves understanding the reading of 'Financial Instruments' and the extra rules."
1,DPEL,"Answer is mostly correct and grounded but slightly overstates the direct citation of MIR 2.7.1 and 2.7.2 in the TARGET; the TARGET states MTF Operators must comply with MIR 2.7.1 and 2.7.2 as if references to Recognised Bodies are references to MTF Operators, which supports the answer"
1,DPEL,Answer includes both required passage tags exactly
1,DPEL,"The question requires both passages to answer correctly, as it involves interpreting rules from both SOURCE and TARGET."
1,DPEL,Answer requires both SOURCE (interpretation of Financial Instruments as Accepted Spot Commodities) and TARGET (MTF Operator must comply with MIR 2.7.1 and 2.7.2 as if references to Recognised Bodies) to be fully correct.

1,DPEL,"Answer correctly states the reading of 'Financial Instruments' per SOURCE and the MIR compliance per TARGET, but the citation in answer slightly reduces clarity (correctness=3)."
1,DPEL,Answering the question mostly relies on SOURCE; TARGET lists applicable MIR rules but does not clarify interpretation of Financial Instruments
1,DPEL,Answer is partially correct and grounded in SOURCE but adds unsupported detail about system adaptation and COBS guidance not explicitly in TARGET
1,DPEL,Realism: The question is clearly realistic and natural for compliance context.
1,DPEL,"Dual_use: The question mostly relies on SOURCE for the interpretation of Financial Instruments as Accepted Spot Commodities; TARGET mainly lists applicable MIR rules for MTF/OTF Operators but does not clarify the interpretation of Financial Instruments, so the question can be mostly answered from SOURCE alone."
1,DPEL,Correctness: The answer correctly reflects the interpretation from SOURCE but adds references to COBS and the need to adapt systems which is implied but not explicitly stated in TARGET; partial correctness due to slight extrapolation.
1,DPEL,"Hard gate fail: The question includes both required tags, and citations in question are allowed, so no hard gate failure."
1,DPEL,Answer requires mostly SOURCE for the key detail about Financial Instruments being treated as Accepted Spot Commodities; TARGET mainly lists applicable rules but does not clarify treatment of Financial Instruments
1,DPEL,Answer is partially correct and grounded in SOURCE; TARGET supports context but does not add to the specific treatment
1,DPEL,Answering the question requires both SOURCE and TARGET to understand the treatment of Financial Instruments.
1,DPEL,The answer is partially correct; it correctly identifies the treatment but lacks full grounding in the TARGET.
1,DPEL,Answer relies mostly on SOURCE for the key interpretation of Financial Instruments as Accepted Spot Commodities; TARGET only provides context on MTF Operator obligations but does not specify treatment of Financial Instruments

1,DPEL,"Answer requires both SOURCE and TARGET to be fully correct: SOURCE for interpretation of Investments as Spot Commodities, TARGET for OTF Operator obligations including pre-trade transparency"
1,DPEL,"Answer correctly cites MIR 3.5 pre-trade transparency from TARGET and the interpretation of Investments from SOURCE, fully grounded in both texts"
1,DPEL,The answer is partially correct; it correctly identifies obligations but does not fully explain the context of pre-trade transparency.
1,DPEL,"Answer requires both SOURCE and TARGET to be fully correct; SOURCE clarifies interpretation of Investments as Spot Commodities, TARGET specifies OTF Operator obligations including MIR 3.5 pre-trade transparency"
1,DPEL,"Answer is mostly correct and grounded; it correctly links OTF Operator obligations to MIR 3.5 from TARGET and the interpretation of Investments as Spot Commodities from SOURCE, but slightly overstates the direct citation of Rules 22.7.1 and 22.7.2 as obligations of OTF Operator (those are interpretation rules from SOURCE)"
1,DPEL,Answer requires both SOURCE (definition of Financial Instruments as Accepted Spot Commodities) and TARGET (MTF Operator must comply with Recognised Bodies rules including MIR 2.7.1 and 2.7.2) to be fully correct

1,DPEL,"Answer requires both SOURCE (definition of Investments as Spot Commodities) and TARGET (OTF Operator must comply with MIR 3.5 and interpret references accordingly) to be fully correct, so dual_use is 4."
1,DPEL,"Answer is mostly correct and grounded but slightly overstates 'required for Rules 22.7.1 and 22.7.2' as the SOURCE states 'for the purposes of Rules 22.7.1 and 22.7.2' which is close; also the TARGET states OTF Operator must comply with MIR 3.5 and interpret references to Recognised Bodies as references to OTF Operator, which is correctly reflected. Minor deduction for slight imprecision."
1,DPEL,"No citations in question, so no violation."
1,DPEL,"The question is realistic and relevant to compliance, asking about understanding of investments in a specific context."
1,DPEL,"The question requires both passages to answer correctly, as the SOURCE defines 'Investments' and the TARGET outlines the obligations of an OTF Operator."
1,DPEL,The answer is partially correct; it correctly identifies 'Investments' as 'Spot Commodities' but does not fully explain the implications of the OTF Operator's obligations.
1,DPEL,"Answer requires both SOURCE (definition of Investments as Spot Commodities) and TARGET (OTF Operator must comply with MIR 3.5 and interpret references accordingly) to be fully correct, though TARGET alone gives partial context (dual_use=3)."

1,DPEL,"Answer requires both SOURCE and TARGET: SOURCE clarifies chapter applicability to Fund Managers, TARGET details rules application and exceptions"
1,DPEL,"Answer correctly states rules apply to Fund Managers and Trustees for every agreement under these Rules, excludes Qualified Investor Funds, and notes SOURCE's chapter does not apply to Fund Managers who follow different provisions"
1,DPEL,The answer is partially correct; it correctly identifies the application of rules but incorrectly states that the SOURCE chapter does not apply to Fund Managers.
1,DPEL,"QUESTION requires both SOURCE and TARGET to answer fully: SOURCE clarifies that the chapter does not apply to Fund Managers who follow different provisions, TARGET details the application of the rules and the exclusion of Qualified Investor Funds"
1,DPEL,"ANSWER correctly references both SOURCE and TARGET, accurately stating the applicability to Fund Managers and Trustees, and the exclusion of Qualified Investor Funds, and notes the different provisions Fund Managers follow as per SOURCE"

1,DPEL,"Answer correctly states the fee structure for Spot Commodities from SOURCE and the $40,000 fee for dealing in investments as Principal from TARGET."
1,DPEL,The answer is partially correct; it correctly identifies the fee structure for Spot Commodities but does not specify the fee from the SOURCE.
1,DPEL,Answer requires both SOURCE (for Spot Commodities fees) and TARGET (for Principal dealing fees) to be correct; removing either would lose completeness.
1,DPEL,Answer correctly states the fees and differences as per the SOURCE and TARGET without hallucination.
1,DPEL,"Answer correctly states additional fees are per Rule 1.2.2 (SOURCE) and annual fees are prorated and paid by specified deadlines (TARGET), but does not explicitly clarify that additional fees are distinct from annual fees beyond implication."
1,DPEL,"The question is realistic and natural for compliance, asking about fees related to financial services permissions."

1,DPEL,Answer requires both SOURCE (fee amounts and highest fee rule) and TARGET (timing of payments) to be fully correct
1,DPEL,"Answer is fully grounded in SOURCE and TARGET, though minor detail on prorating is slightly simplified"
1,DPEL,Answer requires both SOURCE (fee structure for multiple activities) and TARGET (timing of fee payments) to be fully correct
1,DPEL,"Answer is mostly correct and grounded, minor imprecision in 'within twenty days of its due date' vs 'within twenty days of the date on which the fee becomes due' but overall accurate"
1,DPEL,Answering requires both SOURCE (fee structure for multiple activities) and TARGET (timing of fee payments).
1,DPEL,"Answer is mostly correct and grounded, but minor detail on 'first annual fee due within twenty days of its due date' is slightly imprecise; TARGET states 'within twenty days of the date on which the fee becomes due' prorated for remainder of calendar year, which is close but not exact wording."
1,DPEL,"The question requires both SOURCE and TARGET to answer correctly, as it involves both calculation and payment deadlines."
1,DPEL,Answer requires both SOURCE (for prorated calculation based on months left) and TARGET (for exact due dates and payment conditions) to be fully correct.
1,DPEL,"Answer correctly states the first annual fee is due within 20 days and prorated by months left, and next year's fee is due in full by January 31, all grounded in SOURCE and TARGET."
1,DPEL,The answer is mostly correct but lacks some specificity regarding the calculation method mentioned in the SOURCE.
1,DPEL,"Answer requires both SOURCE and TARGET: SOURCE provides the basis for prorating by months left, TARGET provides timing details for initial and subsequent fees."
1,DPEL,Answer correctly states timing and calculation details fully grounded in both SOURCE and TARGET texts.
1,DPEL,Answer correctly and fully reflects the conditions from both SOURCE and TARGET without hallucination
1,DPEL,The question requires both passages to fully answer regarding supplementary fees and their conditions.
1,DPEL,"Answer correctly reflects that extra fees can be charged for substantial additional costs/effort (TARGET) and for complex or novel requests per Regulator's opinion (SOURCE), though the answer slightly simplifies the TARGET wording (correctness=3)."
1,DPEL,"The question requires both passages to answer correctly, as it involves both the conditions for extra fees and the definition of complex or novel requests."
1,DPEL,"Answer correctly reflects that extra fees can be charged for substantial additional costs or effort (TARGET) and that complexity or novelty is a factor per the SOURCE, though the answer slightly simplifies the SOURCE wording (correctness=3)."
1,DPEL,"Answer is fully correct regarding conditions for supplementary fee and relates it to other applications, though slight paraphrasing reduces perfect correctness."
1,DPEL,Answer requires both SOURCE and TARGET: SOURCE specifies conditions for Supplementary Prospectus fees; TARGET generalizes supplementary fees for other applications/authorisations.
1,DPEL,Answer correctly and fully reflects conditions from SOURCE and relates them to broader context from TARGET.
1,DPEL,Answer is fully grounded in SOURCE and TARGET but slightly paraphrased; minor deduction for not quoting exact rule number from SOURCE.
1,DPEL,Answer is mostly correct and grounded; slight deduction as the answer does not explicitly mention 'filing' or 'on-going supervision' from TARGET but captures the essence.
1,DPEL,Answer requires both SOURCE and TARGET to explain when extra fees apply specifically for Supplementary Prospectus and in other cases (dual_use=4).
1,DPEL,"Answer correctly reflects that extra fees for Supplementary Prospectus depend on substantial additional costs or effort (SOURCE) and compares this to other cases where extra fees may be charged for similar reasons (TARGET), but the answer slightly simplifies the TARGET's broader scope (correctness=3)."
1,DPEL,"The question requires both passages to fully answer, as it discusses specific conditions from both SOURCE and TARGET."
1,DPEL,Answer requires both SOURCE and TARGET to fully explain when extra fees apply for Supplementary Prospectus and compare to other cases.

1,DPEL,Answer requires both SOURCE and TARGET to fully address late filing fee and late payment fee details.
1,DPEL,"Answer correctly cites the $500 late filing fee from TARGET and the late payment fees and increments from SOURCE, but does not explicitly mention the exact timing conditions for the late payment fee from SOURCE."
1,DPEL,"The question is realistic and natural for compliance, asking about financial implications."
1,DPEL,"The question requires both passages to answer correctly, as it involves both the late fee and the late payment fee."
1,DPEL,The answer is partially correct; it correctly identifies the late fee but does not fully explain the implications of failing to pay the associated fee on time.
1,DPEL,"Answer requires both SOURCE and TARGET: TARGET provides the $500 late filing fee, SOURCE provides the late payment fee details and monthly increase."
1,DPEL,Answer correctly cites the $500 late filing fee from TARGET and the late payment fee and monthly increase from SOURCE without contradictions.

1,DPEL,Answer requires both SOURCE and TARGET to fully address late submission consequences and Rule 1.2.7 application; removing either passage breaks correctness (dual_use=4).
1,DPEL,"Answer is mostly correct and grounded; minor deduction as the answer states 'must pay a late payment fee of $500' which is from TARGET, and 'breach of a Rule' and 'Regulator may take further action' from SOURCE; Rule 1.2.7 relation to AML Return is correctly stated (correctness=3)."
1,DPEL,"The question requires both passages to answer correctly, as it involves consequences and specific rules."
1,DPEL,Answer requires both SOURCE and TARGET to fully address consequences and Rule 1.2.7 application; removing either passage breaks correctness (dual_use=4).
1,DPEL,"Answer is mostly correct and grounded: correctly states breach, $500 fee from TARGET, Rule 1.2.7 relation from SOURCE, and possible further action; minor deduction as 'must pay' is from TARGET but 'in breach of a Rule' is from SOURCE, and 'must pay' is not explicitly linked to Rule 1.2.7 in TARGET (correctness=3)."
1,DPEL,"Answer requires both SOURCE and TARGET to fully address the question: SOURCE explains breach and possible further actions, TARGET specifies the $500 fee (dual_use=4)."
1,DPEL,"Answer correctly states the $500 fee from TARGET and the possibility of further actions from SOURCE, but does not explicitly mention Rule 1.2.7 details or clarify the exact nature of further actions, so correctness is slightly less than perfect (correctness=3)."
1,DPEL,The answer is partially correct but does not fully address the consequences beyond the fee.
1,DPEL,Answer requires both SOURCE and TARGET: SOURCE explains breach and possible further actions; TARGET specifies the $500 fee for late submissions.
1,DPEL,"Answer correctly states the $500 fee and mentions further actions, grounded in both passages, but does not fully clarify the exact nature of Rule 1.2.7 or the full scope of further actions, so partial correctness."
1,DPEL,Question is naturally phrased and relevant to compliance fee timing differences.

1,DPEL,The answer is partially correct but lacks specific details from the TARGET.
1,DPEL,"dual_use: The question requires both SOURCE and TARGET to answer correctly, as SOURCE explains when the assets test applies and TARGET outlines the test requirements."
1,DPEL,"correctness: The answer correctly states when the assets test applies and its relation to profits test from SOURCE, but incorrectly claims the assets test requirements are not detailed in the passages, ignoring that TARGET states the Applicant must satisfy certain requirements (though not detailed here). This is a partial correctness issue."
1,DPEL,hard_gate_fail: The dual-evidence gate is passed since both passages are needed.
1,DPEL,The answer includes both required passage tags.
1,DPEL,"dual_use: The question can be mostly answered from SOURCE alone; TARGET adds minimal detail and does not provide specifics, so dual-use is low."
1,DPEL,"correctness: The answer incorrectly states the market capitalisation rule applies to Debentures only, which is correct, but it fails to explain the assets eligibility test requirements (TARGET states requirements exist but does not specify), and the answer is vague and partially incorrect about linking assets test to market capitalisation rule."
1,DPEL,"The question requires both passages to answer correctly, as it involves both the assets eligibility test and the market capitalisation rule."

1,DPEL,"Answer is partially correct but incomplete and somewhat misleading: it says specifics of assets eligibility test are not provided (true in TARGET), but incorrectly links market capitalisation rule only to Debentures without clarifying the link to assets eligibility test for Shares; thus correctness is low (score 0)."
1,DPEL,"Hard gate failed: The answer includes both passage tags but the question does not require both passages to answer correctly since the market capitalisation rule is fully in SOURCE and assets eligibility test specifics are missing in TARGET, so dual-evidence gate fails."

1,DPEL,"Answer is not correct or grounded: it states compliance duties from Rule 10.1.8 and Rule 3.9.2 but neither passage provides details or confirms the described obligations; the SOURCE only mentions 'For the purposes of complying with Rule 3.9.2:' without further content, so the answer is unsupported."
1,DPEL,"Answer can be mostly derived from TARGET alone; SOURCE adds minimal value, so dual_use is low."
1,DPEL,Answer is vague and does not specify what Rule 10.1.8 or Rule 3.9.2 require; correctness is low due to lack of grounding in provided texts.

1,DPEL,"Answer relies mostly on SOURCE for reporting requirements and TARGET for remuneration alignment, but reporting details are absent in TARGET, making dual_use partial."
1,DPEL,"Answer partially correct: SOURCE states reporting in annual and half yearly financial statements about going concern, but TARGET only addresses remuneration alignment; answer's claim about reports showing business stability is only from SOURCE."
1,DPEL,"Hard gate on dual-evidence fails because the question can be mostly answered from SOURCE alone regarding reports, and TARGET only adds a slight emphasis on Listed Entity remuneration alignment."

1,DPEL,The answer is partially correct but misstates the requirement for Directors' reports.
1,DPEL,"Answer relies mostly on SOURCE for business stability reports and on TARGET for pay plan alignment, but TARGET alone does not mention reports, and SOURCE alone covers most of the answer; thus dual_use is borderline."
1,DPEL,"Answer partially correct: SOURCE supports reporting on business stability and pay plan alignment; TARGET only supports pay plan alignment for Listed Entity, no mention of reports; answer includes citations which are allowed."
1,DPEL,Hard gate on dual-evidence fails because the question can be mostly answered from SOURCE alone; TARGET adds little unique info on reports.

1,DPEL,The answer is partially correct but contains inaccuracies regarding the disclosure requirements and the citation of rules.
1,DPEL,"Answer requires both SOURCE and TARGET to be fully correct: TARGET provides the 5% threshold and procedures, SOURCE adds the need for approval under Rule 9.5.3 for issuing Securities."
1,DPEL,"Answer is mostly correct and grounded; it correctly states the 5% threshold and shareholder approval requirement from TARGET, and the need for approval under Rule 9.5.3 from SOURCE. However, the answer slightly overstates that approval under Rule 9.5.3 is always required for issuing Securities in related party transactions, while SOURCE only states that an issue of Securities requires such approval. The answer does not mention the cumulative 5% threshold or the material change clause, but these are not asked for explicitly."

1,DPEL,"Answer can be mostly derived from TARGET alone; SOURCE adds limited value, so dual_use is borderline but not clearly needing both."
1,DPEL,"Answer is partially correct but adds unsupported details (e.g., 'good track record of making money' is a simplification of 'track record of profitability or revenue acceptable to the Regulator'), and SOURCE does not mention these conditions explicitly for Listed Entities not needing to be part of Restriction Agreement."
1,DPEL,"The answer is partially correct; it correctly identifies conditions under which a Controller does not have to be part of a Restriction Agreement, but lacks full grounding in the details from both passages."
1,DPEL,"Answer requires both SOURCE and TARGET but mostly relies on TARGET for specifics; SOURCE provides general conditions but not the detailed exceptions about Official List, track record, or tangible assets."

1,DPEL,Answer correctly integrates and reflects information from both SOURCE and TARGET without hallucination or contradiction.
1,DPEL,Question is clearly realistic and relevant to compliance (score 2).
1,DPEL,"Answering the question requires both SOURCE and TARGET, as SOURCE discusses enforcement actions and remedial steps, while TARGET defines the capital requirements (score 3)."
1,DPEL,"Answer is not fully correct: SOURCE does not state that the Regulator considers whether the Authorised Person has ensured compliance with capital requirements under Rules 8.3.3 and 8.3.4; this is only stated in TARGET as a requirement, not as a factor the Regulator considers in enforcement. The answer incorrectly attributes this consideration to the Regulator based on TARGET, which is not supported by SOURCE. Therefore, correctness is 0."
1,DPEL,"The question requires both passages to answer correctly, as it involves both the breach of Rule 8.3.2 and the Financial Group Capital Requirements under Rules 8.3.3 and 8.3.4."
1,DPEL,The answer is partially correct; it mentions the evaluation of circumstances and remedial steps but does not fully address the specifics of compliance with Financial Group Capital Requirements.

1,DPEL,"Answer incorrectly states that the Regulator considers whether the Authorised Person has ensured compliance with capital requirements under Rules 8.3.3 and 8.3.4 when determining enforcement actions, but SOURCE does not mention this consideration; it only mentions taking into account remedial steps and full circumstances."
1,DPEL,TARGET only states the capital requirement obligation but does not link it to enforcement action consideration.
1,DPEL,"Therefore, the answer is not fully grounded in the provided texts."
1,DPEL,Answer is mostly correct and grounded but slightly infers the Regulator's consideration of capital requirements from combining both texts rather than explicit statement.
1,DPEL,"The question is realistic and natural for compliance, asking about consequences and requirements."
1,DPEL,"The question requires both passages to answer correctly, as it involves both the breach of Rule 8.3.2 and the Financial Group Capital Requirements."
1,DPEL,The answer is partially correct; it references the correct rules but does not fully explain the relationship between the breach and the capital requirements.
1,DPEL,Answer is mostly correct and grounded but slightly infers the Regulator's consideration of capital requirements from TARGET rather than explicit linkage in SOURCE.

1,DPEL,"Answer is mostly correct and grounded, but slightly paraphrased and missing explicit mention of Rules 3.10.2, 3.11.2, 3.12.2 from SOURCE; still captures key points accurately"
1,DPEL,"The question requires both passages to answer correctly, as it involves eligibility rules from the SOURCE and maturity calculations from the TARGET."
1,DPEL,"dual_use: The question mostly relies on SOURCE for the calculation method and TARGET only adds a limited scope condition; thus, it is mostly one-sided with minor reference to TARGET."
1,DPEL,correctness: The answer is partially correct and grounded in SOURCE and TARGET but slightly overstates the specificity of conditions from TARGET.
1,DPEL,"Answering the question generally requires both SOURCE and TARGET, but the TARGET only adds a limited scope condition, making it borderline (score 3)."
1,DPEL,"Answer is mostly grounded in SOURCE but the TARGET only partially supports the specific conditions; the answer slightly overstates the TARGET's contribution and misses some detail, so correctness is partial (score 1)."
1,DPEL,Hard gate failed because the answer does not include both exact passage tags as required (missing [#TGT:ba7703d2-eb05-4b88-b13a-0dfe34dd09bd] in the answer).
1,DPEL,"Answer correctly reflects the calculation method, conditions, and applicable transaction types as per SOURCE and TARGET."
1,DPEL,The answer is partially correct; it correctly identifies the need for E* calculation but misstates the application of the FCCA and the types of transactions.
1,DPEL,"Answer is mostly correct and grounded; minor deduction as TARGET only states transaction types without detail on calculation, but overall accurate."
1,DPEL,Answer requires both SOURCE and TARGET: SOURCE for the substitution of E* for E and reference to supervisory/own estimate haircuts; TARGET for the adjustment of exposure and collateral values for market fluctuations using specified haircuts.
1,DPEL,"Answer is mostly correct and grounded, but slightly paraphrased and does not explicitly mention the exact rule numbers from SOURCE for supervisory/own estimate haircuts, so correctness is 3 instead of 4."
1,DPEL,Answer requires both SOURCE and TARGET to be fully correct: SOURCE provides the substitution of E* for E and the context of qualifying bilateral Netting agreements; TARGET provides the detail on adjusting exposure and collateral values for market fluctuations using specified haircuts.
1,DPEL,"Answer is mostly correct and grounded but slightly imprecise on exact rule references (SOURCE cites A4.3.2 to A4.3.6, TARGET cites A4.3.6 to A4.3.29). Overall, the answer correctly captures the essence of both passages."
1,DPEL,Answer requires both SOURCE and TARGET: SOURCE explains substitution of E* for E under FCCA and qualifying bilateral Netting agreement; TARGET explains adjustment of Exposure and Collateral for market changes using specified rules.
1,DPEL,"The question requires both SOURCE and TARGET to answer correctly, as it involves both the calculation of E* and the adjustment for market changes."
1,DPEL,Answer requires both SOURCE (for the substitution of E* for E and reference to qualifying bilateral Netting agreement) and TARGET (for the adjustment of Exposure and Collateral values for market changes using specified haircuts).
1,DPEL,Answer requires both SOURCE and TARGET to fully address the methods for haircuts and relation to Credit Risk weighted Exposure calculation
1,DPEL,"Answer is fully correct in describing the methods for haircuts from TARGET and the substitution of E* for E from SOURCE, but minor deduction for not explicitly quoting exact rule numbers from TARGET"
1,DPEL,Clearly requires both SOURCE and TARGET to answer correctly.
1,DPEL,Answer requires both SOURCE and TARGET to fully address the methods for haircuts and relation to Credit Risk weighted Exposure calculation.
1,DPEL,"Answer is mostly correct and grounded, though the explanation of relation to Credit Risk weighted Exposure is more explicit in SOURCE; TARGET only covers haircut methods."
1,DPEL,"Answer requires both SOURCE and TARGET: SOURCE explains when and why E* is used and its effect on Credit Risk weighted Exposure, TARGET specifies the haircut methods for calculating E*."
1,DPEL,"Answer correctly states the calculation methods for E* and the substitution of E* for E in Credit Risk weighted Exposure calculation, fully grounded in both passages."
1,DPEL,Answer requires both SOURCE and TARGET: SOURCE explains when and why E* is used and its effect on Credit Risk weighted Exposure; TARGET specifies the methods for calculating haircuts for E*.
1,DPEL,"Answer can be mostly derived from SOURCE alone; TARGET only adds a brief exclusion phrase without detail, so dual_use is low (1)."
1,DPEL,Answer is partially correct but the TARGET does not clearly specify the excluded transactions as in the answer; partial grounding only (correctness=2).
1,DPEL,Hard gate fails because the answer does not include the exact passage tags as required (missing exact tags in answer).
1,DPEL,"The question is realistic and natural for compliance, asking about specific calculations and exclusions."
1,DPEL,"dual_use: The question requires information from both SOURCE and TARGET to answer correctly, though the TARGET is minimal."
1,DPEL,"correctness: The answer incorrectly states that excluded transactions are collateralised transactions that are not OTC Derivative or long settlement transactions, but the TARGET states the calculation is for collateralised transactions other than OTC Derivative and long settlement transactions, implying these are included, not excluded. This is a contradiction and thus the answer is not fully correct."
1,DPEL,Question is realistic and well-phrased for compliance context.
1,DPEL,"Answer can be mostly derived from SOURCE alone; TARGET adds minimal relevant detail, so dual_use is low."
1,DPEL,Answer is partially correct but TARGET does not clearly specify the types of transactions excluded; it only titles the section without detail.
1,DPEL,"The question requires both passages to answer correctly, as it involves specific calculations from the SOURCE and exclusions from the TARGET."
1,DPEL,Answer can be mostly derived from SOURCE alone; TARGET adds minimal info and is vague
1,DPEL,Answer incorrectly states that excluded transactions are 'collateralised transactions that are not OTC Derivative transactions or long settlement transactions' which is not fully supported by TARGET; TARGET only has a fragment and does not clearly define exclusions
1,DPEL,Hard gate fails because the answer does not include both passage tags exactly as required (the SOURCE tag is correct but the TARGET tag is not exactly as in TARGET text)
1,DPEL,Dual-evidence gate fails because the question can be answered mostly from SOURCE alone
1,DPEL,Answer requires both SOURCE and TARGET to fully address the calculation for netting agreements and collateralised transactions not covered by such agreements

1,DPEL,"The question requires both passages to answer correctly, as it involves both the treatment of CR Exposure and the risk weights."
1,DPEL,The answer is partially correct; it references the correct rules but does not fully explain the risk weights as required.
1,DPEL,Answer requires both SOURCE (treatment per Rule 4.12.4 if Rule 4.12.5 not met) and TARGET (risk weighting details for central government and central bank asset class) to be fully correct.
1,DPEL,"Answer is mostly correct and grounded, but slightly vague on the exact risk weighting application; it correctly references both rules and the table but does not fully explain the risk weighting process."

1,DPEL,Answer requires both SOURCE (conditions for zero value) and TARGET (risk weighting table) to be fully correct.
1,DPEL,Answer is mostly correct and grounded; minor deduction as the answer references 'table in relevant rules' but does not explicitly quote the exact risk weight percentages from TARGET.
1,DPEL,Answer requires both SOURCE (zero value conditions) and TARGET (risk weight connection) to be fully correct
1,DPEL,Answer correctly reflects conditions for zero value and links to risk weight of 0% for Credit Quality Grade 1
1,DPEL,"The question requires both passages to answer correctly, as it involves both the conditions for using zero values and the risk weights."
1,DPEL,The answer is partially correct; it correctly identifies when a zero value can be used but does not fully explain the connection to risk weights.

1,DPEL,"The question requires both passages to answer correctly, as it involves conditions from the TARGET and treatment from the SOURCE."
1,DPEL,"Answer is fully correct regarding conditions and treatment, but minor deduction as the answer paraphrases rather than quotes exact rule numbers from TARGET; still fully grounded."
1,DPEL,"Answer is fully correct regarding conditions and consequences, but minor detail about Rule 4.12.4 specifics is not elaborated, so correctness is slightly less than perfect."
1,DPEL,"Answer is fully grounded in TARGET for the 0% risk weight condition and in SOURCE for the consequence, but the explanation of consequences is brief and could be more detailed."

1,DPEL,Answer correctly states the conditions from SOURCE and the risk weight table from TARGET without hallucination or contradiction.
1,DPEL,Answer requires both SOURCE (for when CRM can be used) and TARGET (for risk weights) to be correct; removing either breaks correctness.
1,DPEL,Answer is mostly correct and grounded; minor issue is that the SOURCE does not explicitly say 'for a Credit Derivative' but implies CRM of a Credit Derivative can be recognized if from MDB; risk weights match TARGET exactly.
1,DPEL,"The question requires both passages to answer correctly, as the SOURCE provides the conditions for using CRM and the TARGET provides the risk weights."
1,DPEL,Answer requires both SOURCE (for when CRM from MDB can be used) and TARGET (for risk weights) to be correct.

1,DPEL,Answer correctly states conditions from SOURCE and risk weight plus examples from TARGET without hallucination.
1,DPEL,Answer requires both SOURCE (to confirm when CRM can be used) and TARGET (to identify risk weight and MDB list).
1,DPEL,The answer is partially correct; it correctly identifies the 0% risk weight but incorrectly states the conditions for using CRM.
1,DPEL,Answer requires both SOURCE (for conditions on CRM use) and TARGET (for risk weight and MDB list).
1,DPEL,Answer requires both SOURCE (conditions for CRM recognition) and TARGET (risk weight for CR Exposure) to be correct.
1,DPEL,"Answer correctly states conditions for CRM recognition from SOURCE and risk weight application from TARGET, but slightly paraphrases and omits some details from SOURCE (e.g., other entities besides MDB)."
1,DPEL,"The question requires both passages to answer correctly, as it involves CRM recognition and risk weight application."
1,DPEL,Answer requires both SOURCE (conditions for CRM recognition) and TARGET (risk weight application) to be fully correct.
1,DPEL,"Answer is mostly correct and grounded; minor detail missing about other entities allowed for CRM recognition but question focuses on MDB and risk weight application, which is correctly answered."
1,DPEL,Answer requires both SOURCE (conditions for CRM use) and TARGET (risk weight for certain banks) to be fully correct
1,DPEL,Answer correctly reflects conditions for CRM use from SOURCE and risk weight from TARGET

1,DPEL,"The question requires both passages to answer correctly, as it involves CRM recognition from the SOURCE and risk weight from the TARGET."
1,DPEL,Answer requires both SOURCE (for when CRM can be used) and TARGET (for risk weight on certain banks)
1,DPEL,Answer is mostly correct and grounded but slightly vague on exact MDB references and risk weight application scope

1,DPEL,"The question requires both passages to answer correctly, as it involves both the eligibility of MDBs and the risk weight."
1,DPEL,Answer requires both SOURCE (eligibility of MDBs as guarantors) and TARGET (list of MDBs and 0% risk weight) to be fully correct.
1,DPEL,"dual_use: The question requires both SOURCE and TARGET but the answer relies mostly on TARGET for 0% risk weight and SOURCE for eligible guarantors, making it borderline but not fully dual-use."
1,DPEL,"correctness: The answer correctly cites both passages but incorrectly states that 0% risk weight applies to guarantees by MDBs generally, whereas TARGET specifies only certain MDBs for 0% risk weight; also, the answer mixes conditions for CRM recognition and 0% risk weight application."
1,DPEL,"The question requires both passages to answer correctly, as it involves conditions from the TARGET and entities from the SOURCE."
1,DPEL,"Answer requires both SOURCE and TARGET but could be mostly answered from SOURCE alone regarding eligible entities; TARGET only adds specific MDBs for 0% risk weight, so dual_use is borderline (2)."
1,DPEL,"Answer is partially correct but includes references to rules (4.12.8, 4.12.9) not explained in the passages, and the 0% risk weight condition is only for exposures to specific MDBs, not all guarantees by MDBs; partial correctness (2)."
1,DPEL,"Hard gate failed because the question includes rule identifiers (4.12.8, 4.12.9) which is forbidden if forbid_citations_in_question=true (here it is false, so no fail), and both passage tags are included, so no hard gate fail."
1,DPEL,Dual-evidence gate fails because the question can be mostly answered from SOURCE alone about eligible entities and from TARGET alone about 0% risk weight MDBs; the question does not strictly require both for a full correct answer.
1,DPEL,Answer requires both SOURCE and TARGET to fully address the conditions and entities involved.
1,DPEL,Answer is mostly correct and grounded but slightly imprecise in linking the exact conditions for 0% risk weight to guarantees from MDBs.
1,DPEL,The answer is partially correct but contains inaccuracies regarding the entities that can provide guarantees.
1,DPEL,"Answer requires both SOURCE and TARGET: TARGET specifies when 0% risk weight applies (to certain MDBs), SOURCE specifies who can provide guarantees for CRM recognition."
1,DPEL,"Answer is mostly correct and grounded; it correctly combines the 0% risk weight condition from TARGET with guarantee provider list from SOURCE, but the answer slightly overgeneralizes the 0% risk weight to 'certain MDBs' rather than only those listed in TARGET."

1,DPEL,"The answer is fully correct and grounded in both SOURCE and TARGET, accurately describing eligible financial collateral."
1,DPEL,Answer requires both SOURCE and TARGET to be fully correct: SOURCE clarifies FCCA relates to Rule 4.13.6 and contrasts with FCSA/Rule 4.13.5; TARGET details eligible collateral per FCCA including Rule 4.13.5 instruments and Collective Investment Fund conditions (dual_use=4).
1,DPEL,Answer is mostly correct and grounded but slightly imprecise on FCCA being based on Rule 4.13.6 rather than Rule 4.13.5; minor deduction for slight ambiguity (correctness=3).

1,DPEL,Answer requires both SOURCE and TARGET to fully address when publication can occur and what happens on appeal.
1,DPEL,"Answer is mostly correct and grounded; slight deduction as the appeal detail is only in SOURCE, but overall accurate."
1,DPEL,"Answer relies mostly on SOURCE for the appeals process detail; TARGET only states publication discretion without appeals info, so dual_use is borderline."
1,DPEL,Answer is partially correct and grounded but adds appeals detail only from SOURCE; TARGET does not mention appeals or publication upon appeal.
1,DPEL,Answer requires both SOURCE and TARGET to fully address internal and external aspects of risk management (dual_use=4).
1,DPEL,Answer is mostly correct and grounded but slightly paraphrased; it accurately reflects both passages (correctness=3).
1,DPEL,"The question requires both passages to answer correctly, as it involves both internal assessments and external reviews."

1,DPEL,"Question does not contain citations, so no citation rule violation."
1,DPEL,"Answer requires both SOURCE and TARGET to address conditions and form of application, but TARGET is minimal and does not explicitly state conditions or form."
1,DPEL,"Answer incorrectly states the application must be from an 'Authorised Person' per TARGET, but TARGET only has a heading and no explicit condition; SOURCE states 'firm' and form prescribed, but no mention of 'Authorised Person'."
1,DPEL,"Hard gate on dual-evidence passes as question requires both, but correctness is low due to incomplete grounding in TARGET."
1,DPEL,The answer is partially correct; it mentions the need for a prescribed form but lacks detail on the conditions under which the request can be made.
1,DPEL,Answer requires both SOURCE and TARGET to address conditions and form
1,DPEL,"Answer incorrectly states the application is specifically applicable only to an Authorised Person, which is not supported by SOURCE or TARGET"
1,DPEL,SOURCE states application must be in prescribed form; TARGET mentions variation at request of Authorised Person but does not limit to only them
1,DPEL,"Answering the question generally requires both SOURCE and TARGET, as SOURCE mentions the form of request and TARGET specifies the request must be by an Authorised Person (score 3)."
1,DPEL,"The answer is not fully correct or grounded: SOURCE states the request must be 'in such form as we may prescribe' but does not specify who must initiate it; TARGET states variation is 'at the request of an Authorised Person' but does not mention the form. The answer incorrectly combines these without direct textual support that the form requirement applies to the Authorised Person's request. Also, TARGET does not mention cancellation, only variation. Thus, the answer is partially correct but not fully grounded (score 0)."
1,DPEL,"Hard gate failure: The answer does include both passage tags exactly, so that gate passes."
1,DPEL,"The question does not include citations, so that gate passes."
1,DPEL,Dual-evidence gate passes as the question requires both passages.

1,DPEL,Answer partially correct but introduces unsupported requirement about Authorised Person
1,DPEL,Question is realistic and naturally phrased for compliance (score 2).
1,DPEL,"Answer can be mostly derived from SOURCE alone, as it explicitly lists the power to vary or cancel permissions under FSMR sections 33 and 233; TARGET is too vague and incomplete to add substantial information (dual_use score 1)."
1,DPEL,"Answer includes information not present in either passage, such as the process of assessing conditions and ensuring compliance, which is not grounded in the provided texts (correctness score 0)."
1,DPEL,Hard gate requiring no citations in question is met (forbid_citations_in_question=false).

1,DPEL,Answer is not fully correct or grounded: TARGET passage is incomplete and does not explain circumstances or relation to FSMR sections 33 and 233; SOURCE lists powers but does not explain circumstances or relation in detail; answer adds unsupported details about process and assessment.
1,DPEL,Hard gate fail: The answer does not include the exact passage tags as required; the TARGET passage tag is included but the SOURCE tag is not present in the answer text.
1,DPEL,"Answer relies mostly on SOURCE for powers and TARGET for timing, but could be answered mostly from SOURCE alone."
1,DPEL,"Answer is partially correct but vague; TARGET does not explicitly state when the Regulator can change or cancel permission, only that it can do so on its own initiative."
1,DPEL,Hard gate failed because the question does not clearly require both passages; dual-evidence gate fails.
1,DPEL,The answer incorrectly states that the Regulator can change or cancel permissions on its own initiative without correctly referencing the powers in the SOURCE.

1,DPEL,Correctness is partially correct; it references the correct sections but lacks clarity on the relationship between the two actions.
1,DPEL,Answer requires both SOURCE and TARGET to address the relationship between conditions on Approved Persons and requirements on firms
1,DPEL,"Answer incorrectly cites FSMR section 48 for the Regulator's authority to impose or vary conditions on an Approved Person, which is supported by SOURCE, but the TARGET provides no substantive information on the imposition of requirements on a firm, only a heading"
1,DPEL,Answer includes information about the relationship between imposing conditions on Approved Persons and requirements on firms that is not supported by the TARGET text
1,DPEL,"Answer partially grounded in SOURCE but not fully supported by TARGET, leading to correctness score of 0"
1,DPEL,Answer can be mostly derived from SOURCE alone; TARGET provides no clear information on conditions for Approved Persons or linking to firm rules.

1,DPEL,Answer correctly states the 6 months running costs requirement for both entities and notes the additional buffer for Recognised Investment Exchange as per TARGET.
1,DPEL,Answer requires both SOURCE (stipulation and Spot Commodities Framework) and TARGET (COBS rules applying only to that function) to be fully correct.
1,DPEL,Answer correctly states conditions and frameworks as per both SOURCE and TARGET without hallucination or contradiction.
1,DPEL,"The question is realistic and natural for compliance, asking about specific conditions and frameworks."
1,DPEL,"The question requires both SOURCE and TARGET to answer correctly, as it involves stipulations from both."
1,DPEL,"Answer requires both SOURCE and TARGET: SOURCE provides conditions and framework, TARGET adds the application of COBS rules to the function only."
1,DPEL,Answer correctly and fully reflects conditions and framework from SOURCE and the COBS rule application from TARGET.
1,DPEL,Answer requires both SOURCE and TARGET to fully address conditions and applicable rules
1,DPEL,Answer correctly reflects conditions from SOURCE and rule application from TARGET
1,DPEL,Answer requires both SOURCE (for Spot Commodities Framework and Recognition Order condition) and TARGET (for COBS rules applying only to that function)
1,DPEL,Answer correctly and fully reflects conditions and rules from both SOURCE and TARGET
1,DPEL,"Answer is fully grounded in SOURCE and TARGET, though slight paraphrasing reduces perfect correctness score."
1,DPEL,"Answer is fully grounded in SOURCE and TARGET, though minor detail on MIR Rule 3.4.1 from SOURCE is not explicitly mentioned but not critical; overall correct."
1,DPEL,Answer requires both SOURCE (about relinquishing FSP upon Recognition Order) and TARGET (stipulation in Recognition Order for MTF/OTF operation) to be fully correct.
1,DPEL,Answer is mostly correct and grounded; minor detail about FSRA licensing and MIR Rule 3.4.1 not mentioned but not critical for correctness.
1,DPEL,The answer is mostly correct but lacks full grounding in the SOURCE regarding the specific rules for MTFs and OTFs.
1,DPEL,Answer requires both SOURCE (relinquishing FSP upon Recognition Order) and TARGET (Recognition Order must permit MTF/OTF operation and application of COBS rules) to be fully correct
1,DPEL,Answer correctly states the conditions for relinquishing FSP and the stipulation in the Recognition Order with proper citations
1,DPEL,Answer is mostly correct and grounded; slight deduction as the TARGET is brief and the answer slightly extrapolates 'broader market operations' but remains faithful to the text.
1,DPEL,"Answer is mostly correct and grounded; minor deduction as the TARGET states 'must also operate a market that complies with Recognition Requirements' but does not elaborate on how it relates, so the answer's explanation is slightly interpretive but consistent."
1,DPEL,"Answer is mostly correct and grounded; minor deduction as 'MIR Rules' is mentioned but not fully explained, and 'Recognition Requirements' relation is somewhat general but accurate."
1,DPEL,"The question is realistic and relevant to compliance, asking about rules for RIEs."
1,DPEL,"The question requires both SOURCE and TARGET to answer correctly, as it involves rules and recognition requirements."
1,DPEL,The answer is mostly correct but lacks some detail from the TARGET regarding compliance with Recognition Requirements.
1,DPEL,"Answer correctly references the need for a Recognition Order, compliance with Spot Commodities Framework, MIR Rules, and Recognition Requirements, but slightly paraphrases rather than quoting exactly."
1,DPEL,Answer requires both SOURCE (conditions for operating MTF/OTF with Accepted Spot Commodities) and TARGET (additional market compliance with Recognition Requirements) to be fully correct.
1,DPEL,Answer correctly states the conditions from SOURCE and the additional compliance from TARGET without hallucination.
1,DPEL,"The question is realistic and natural for compliance, asking about specific conditions and compliance requirements."
1,DPEL,The answer is incorrect as it misstates the compliance requirements; it does not accurately reflect the requirements from the TARGET.
1,DPEL,Answer requires both SOURCE (conditions for operating MTF/OTF with Accepted Spot Commodities) and TARGET (additional market compliance with Recognition Requirements)
1,DPEL,"Answer is mostly correct and grounded; minor deduction as the answer references MIR Rule 3.4.2 which is in SOURCE but not fully explained, and the TARGET states compliance with Recognition Requirements without detail"
1,DPEL,Answer requires both SOURCE (permission and rule) and TARGET (Recognition Requirements) to be fully correct
1,DPEL,"Answer is mostly correct and grounded, slight deduction as 'Recognition Requirements' is not explicitly stated as a must in SOURCE but implied by TARGET"
1,DPEL,"The question requires both passages to answer correctly, as it involves both the permission from FSRA and the Recognition Requirements."
1,DPEL,The answer is incorrect as it does not accurately reflect the requirements stated in the SOURCE and TARGET.
1,DPEL,Answer requires both SOURCE (permission and rule reference) and TARGET (must meet Recognition Requirements) to be fully correct.
1,DPEL,Answer correctly states conditions from SOURCE and obligation from TARGET without hallucination.
1,DPEL,"Answer requires both SOURCE and TARGET to address format and disclosure requirements, but mostly relies on TARGET for format and SOURCE for disclosure conditions, so dual_use is 3."
1,DPEL,"Answer is partially correct but slightly inaccurate: SOURCE states MTF/OTF must use consistent and structured format per MIR Rule 3.7.4, TARGET says format based on industry standards for Recognised Investment Exchanges, which is not explicitly in SOURCE; also, SOURCE mentions reliability, continuous monitoring, and non-discriminatory availability for MTF/OTF, not explicitly for Recognised Investment Exchanges, so correctness is partial."
1,DPEL,Hard gate for both passage tags is passed.
1,DPEL,"Answer requires both SOURCE and TARGET to address format and disclosure requirements, but TARGET alone gives partial answer"
1,DPEL,"Answer incorrectly attributes requirements to Recognised Investment Exchanges that are stated for MTF or OTF in SOURCE; TARGET states Recognised Investment Exchanges can choose structure, conflicting with SOURCE's requirement for consistent format"
1,DPEL,"Hard gate failed because the answer does not include both passage tags exactly as required (the answer includes both tags but not exactly as required in the question text, so this is ambiguous but assuming tags are present)"
1,DPEL,Dual-evidence gate passes as question requires both passages
1,DPEL,Correctness is partial due to misattribution and incomplete coverage of requirements
1,DPEL,Answer is mostly correct and grounded but slightly overgeneralizes 'industry standards' from TARGET; SOURCE states consistent and structured format without explicit mention of industry standards
1,DPEL,"The question requires both passages to answer correctly, as it involves both public disclosure requirements and format rules."
1,DPEL,"Answer correctly states reliability, continuous monitoring, equal availability from SOURCE and consistent, structured format with industry standards from TARGET, but slightly generalizes SOURCE's mention of MTF/OTF to Recognised Investment Exchanges"
1,DPEL,"Answer requires both SOURCE and TARGET to fully address the question, especially the role of Remote Clearing House from SOURCE and the detailed obligations from TARGET"
1,DPEL,"Answer is mostly correct and grounded; it accurately reflects the TARGET's description of obligations and SOURCE's note on Remote Clearing House sufficiency, but the answer slightly overstates the citation of MIR Rule 3.8.2 as a direct quote rather than paraphrase"
1,DPEL,Answer requires both SOURCE and TARGET: TARGET defines the general obligation for Recognised Investment Exchanges; SOURCE provides the specific role of Remote Clearing House in satisfying the requirement.
1,DPEL,"Answer is mostly correct and grounded; it accurately reflects the obligations from TARGET and the role of Remote Clearing House from SOURCE, though the answer slightly overstates the citation of MIR Rule 3.8.2 as a direct quote rather than paraphrase."
1,DPEL,Answer requires both SOURCE (for Remote Clearing House role) and TARGET (for general settlement obligations) to be fully correct
1,DPEL,Answer correctly reflects the obligations from TARGET and the sufficiency of Remote Clearing House from SOURCE
1,DPEL,"The answer is mostly correct but lacks full grounding in the SOURCE, as it does not explicitly mention the requirement from MIR Rule 3.8.1."
1,DPEL,Answer requires both SOURCE (for Remote Clearing House detail) and TARGET (for general settlement obligations) to be fully correct
1,DPEL,Answer correctly reflects the requirements from TARGET and the sufficiency of Remote Clearing House from SOURCE
1,DPEL,Answering requires both SOURCE (details on MIR Rule 3.8.1 and 3.8.2) and TARGET (explicit statement of sufficiency) to confirm conditions.
1,DPEL,Answer is mostly correct and grounded but slightly paraphrased; minor deduction for not quoting TARGET exactly but meaning is preserved.
1,DPEL,"Answer requires both SOURCE and TARGET: SOURCE explains the requirement and allowance, TARGET confirms sufficiency of engagement"
1,DPEL,Answer requires both SOURCE and TARGET to confirm sufficiency and context of RCH/Remote Clearing House
1,DPEL,Answer is mostly correct and grounded but slightly paraphrased; minor deduction for not quoting exact rule numbers
1,DPEL,Answer requires both SOURCE and TARGET to confirm the sufficiency of RCH/Remote Clearing House for meeting the rules.
1,DPEL,Answer is mostly correct and grounded; slight deduction as the answer paraphrases rather than quotes exact rule numbers.
1,DPEL,"Answer relies mostly on SOURCE for the main requirements; TARGET only provides a similar but not identical obligation for Recognised Investment Exchanges, not MTF/OTF"
1,DPEL,"Answer is partially correct and grounded in SOURCE; the TARGET's obligation is for a different entity and rule, so the linkage is somewhat inferred but not explicit"
1,DPEL,Hard gate for dual-evidence fails because the question can be answered mostly from SOURCE alone; TARGET does not directly address MTF/OTF or SCSF communication requirements
1,DPEL,Answer is partially correct but does not fully address the communication requirement to the FSRA from the TARGET.
1,DPEL,"Answer relies mostly on SOURCE; TARGET only provides analogous confirmation requirement for Recognised Investment Exchange, not directly for MTF/OTF"
1,DPEL,"Answer partially correct: SOURCE supports SCSF compliance and FSRA notification, TARGET supports confirmation in writing but for a different entity (Recognised Investment Exchange), not explicitly MTF/OTF"
1,DPEL,Answer is mostly correct and grounded; minor deduction as the answer slightly generalizes the TARGET's mention of Recognised Investment Exchange to MTF/OTF but is consistent with the question context.
1,DPEL,Realistic question regarding regulatory compliance.
1,DPEL,Answer is partially correct but lacks clarity and completeness regarding the requirements.
1,DPEL,Answer correctly integrates requirements from SOURCE and TARGET without hallucination or contradiction.
1,DPEL,Answer requires both SOURCE (MTF/OTF arrangements when not using RCH) and TARGET (RCH compliance status when unable to settle a transaction) to be fully correct
1,DPEL,"The question requires both passages to answer correctly, as it involves conditions from the SOURCE and compliance status from the TARGET."
1,DPEL,The answer is incorrect as it misinterprets the compliance status of the Recognised Clearing House.
1,DPEL,Answer requires both SOURCE (MTF/OTF arrangements and SCSF compliance) and TARGET (RCH compliance status on specific transactions) to be fully correct
1,DPEL,Answer correctly reflects the conditions for MTF/OTF arrangements and the compliance status of RCH as per SOURCE and TARGET
1,DPEL,Answer requires both SOURCE (MTF/OTF must show FSRA plans for SCSF use) and TARGET (RCH not failing if unable to settle a transaction) to be fully correct.
1,DPEL,Answer correctly reflects the requirements and conditions stated in both SOURCE and TARGET without hallucination.
1,DPEL,"The question requires both passages to answer correctly, as it involves both the SCSF requirements and the RCH settlement issue."
1,DPEL,The answer is incorrect; it misstates the conditions under which an MTF or OTF must show plans to the FSRA.
1,DPEL,Answer requires both SOURCE (for timing and conditions of showing plans to FSRA) and TARGET (for consequences if RCH cannot settle) to be fully correct.
1,DPEL,"The question requires both passages to answer correctly, as it involves both the Recognition Requirement and the evaluation criteria for Spot Commodity Settlement Facilities."
1,DPEL,Answer correctly integrates the TARGET's principle and SOURCE's detailed criteria without hallucination or contradiction (correctness=4).
1,DPEL,Answer requires both SOURCE (details on SCSF rules) and TARGET (statement about Recognised Clearing House not failing) to be fully correct
1,DPEL,Answer correctly reflects that Recognised Clearing House is not failing just because it can't settle a trade and that FSRA considers SCSF rules to determine reasons
1,DPEL,"The question requires both passages to answer correctly, as it involves both the rules of the Recognised Clearing House and the role of Spot Commodity Settlement Facilities."
1,DPEL,The answer is partially correct; it correctly states that a Recognised Clearing House is not seen as breaking the rules but lacks detail on the role of Spot Commodity Settlement Facilities' rules.
1,DPEL,Answer requires both SOURCE and TARGET: TARGET states the rule about Recognised Clearing House not breaking rules if unable to settle a trade; SOURCE explains the role of Spot Commodity Settlement Facilities' rules in FSRA's assessment
1,DPEL,Answer requires both SOURCE (listing conditions) and TARGET (membership criteria) to be fully correct
1,DPEL,"The question requires both passages to answer correctly, as it involves conditions from the SOURCE and membership criteria from the TARGET."
1,DPEL,Answer requires both SOURCE (conditions for listing Exempt Offer Securities) and TARGET (membership criteria by Recognised Body) to be fully correct; removing either would lose key information.
1,DPEL,Answer correctly and fully reflects the conditions and membership criteria as stated in SOURCE and TARGET without hallucination.
1,DPEL,"The question requires both passages to answer correctly, as it addresses both the trading conditions and membership checks."
1,DPEL,Answer requires both SOURCE and TARGET to fully confirm all conditions and regulatory context
1,DPEL,Answer correctly and fully reflects the combined requirements from both passages
1,DPEL,"The question requires both SOURCE and TARGET to answer correctly, as both passages provide essential conditions."
1,DPEL,Answer requires both SOURCE and TARGET to confirm all conditions and the inclusion of 'including the Rules' from TARGET (dual_use=4).
1,DPEL,"Answer is mostly correct and grounded, but slightly paraphrased and missing explicit mention of 'including the Rules' in compliance arrangements from TARGET, so correctness is 3."
1,DPEL,Answer requires both SOURCE and TARGET: SOURCE provides client number limits and knowledge assessment; TARGET details systems and controls obligations and additional compliance requirements.
1,DPEL,"Answer requires both SOURCE and TARGET to fully address obligations, including client limits and systems/controls."
1,DPEL,Answer is mostly correct and grounded; minor deduction as it does not explicitly mention COBS Rule 8.2.2 from SOURCE but covers main points well.
1,DPEL,Answer requires both SOURCE (client limits and assessment) and TARGET (systems and controls requirements) to be fully correct (dual_use=4).
1,DPEL,"Answer is mostly correct and grounded, but slightly paraphrased and missing explicit mention of some details like MIR rule references (correctness=3)."
1,DPEL,Answer requires both SOURCE and TARGET to fully address the requirements about Retail Clients and systems (dual_use=4).
1,DPEL,"Answer is mostly correct and grounded in both passages, though minor detail about 'assessed knowledge' is from SOURCE and system requirements from TARGET (correctness=3)."
1,DPEL,Answer requires both SOURCE (greenwashing and undesirable/misleading names) and TARGET (conflicting names) to be fully correct
1,DPEL,Answer correctly cites both passages and accurately reflects the conditions under which the Regulator may direct a name change
1,DPEL,The answer requires both passages to fully address the circumstances under which the Regulator can act.

1,DPEL,Answer correctly cites both passages and accurately reflects regulator's power and conditions for name change
1,DPEL,The question is realistic and relevant to compliance regarding fund names.
1,DPEL,The answer requires both passages to fully address the conditions under which a name change can be mandated.
1,DPEL,Answer correctly reflects the regulator's power to direct name changes for misleading or undesirable names and name conflicts
1,DPEL,"Answer requires both SOURCE and TARGET: SOURCE for Green/Climate compliance details, TARGET for specific report content requirements"
1,DPEL,The answer is partially correct but does not fully address all aspects required by both passages.

1,DPEL,The question is realistic and relevant to compliance reporting for funds.
1,DPEL,"The answer requires both SOURCE and TARGET to fully address the question, as it involves specific requirements from both passages."
1,DPEL,"The answer is partially correct, as it includes relevant information but lacks some details from the TARGET."
1,DPEL,"Answer requires both SOURCE and TARGET to confirm obligations and additional Prospectus requirements; TARGET alone does not mention Prospectus, SOURCE alone does not explicitly state the general communication obligation (dual_use=3)."
1,DPEL,Answer correctly reflects the obligations from both SOURCE and TARGET without hallucination (correctness=4).
1,DPEL,"No citation in question, so no violation of forbid_citations_in_question."
1,DPEL,"The question requires both passages to answer correctly, as it addresses both communication and Prospectus requirements."
1,DPEL,The answer is incorrect as it misattributes the requirement for Prospectus information to the SOURCE instead of the TARGET.
1,DPEL,"dual_use: The question requires both SOURCE and TARGET to answer correctly, as SOURCE provides specific rules and TARGET states the general obligation."
1,DPEL,"correctness: The answer incorrectly cites specific rules from SOURCE and TARGET tags, which are not present in the texts; also, the TARGET does not mention Prospectus or FUNDS Rule 9.3.1(1), so the answer is only partially correct."
1,DPEL,"The question requires both passages to answer correctly, as it involves both Specified Investments and Prospectuses."
1,DPEL,The answer is partially correct but includes unnecessary citations and does not clearly distinguish between the rules.
1,DPEL,"Answer requires both SOURCE and TARGET: TARGET provides the core obligation for Specified Investment communications, SOURCE links this to Offers of Securities in ADGM and references COBS and MKT rules (dual_use=3)."
1,DPEL,"Answer correctly states the obligation to ensure communications are clear, fair, and not misleading, and correctly references both passages without hallucination (correctness=4)."
1,DPEL,"Answer requires both SOURCE and TARGET: SOURCE provides context on Offers of Securities in ADGM and references COBS and MKT rules; TARGET states the clear, fair, and not misleading communication requirement (dual_use=3)."
1,DPEL,Answer correctly states the reasonable steps requirement from TARGET and links it to COBS and MKT requirements from SOURCE without hallucination (correctness=4).
1,DPEL,"Answer requires both SOURCE and TARGET to fully address the question, especially linking communication correctness and securities offering in ADGM (dual_use=3)."
1,DPEL,"Answer correctly states the requirement for communications to be clear, fair, and not misleading, citing TARGET, and relates it to securities offering rules in ADGM from SOURCE (correctness=4)."
1,DPEL,"The question requires both passages to answer correctly, but could be mostly answered with the TARGET alone (3)."
1,DPEL,The answer is partially correct but does not fully address the requirements from both passages (1).

1,SCHEMA,"Hard gate fail: The question includes rule/section identifiers (e.g., 'Fund Manager', 'annual report', 'green or climate-focused Funds') but no explicit rule numbers; however, the setting forbid_citations_in_question=true forbids any rule/section identifiers, so this is borderline but acceptable as no explicit rule numbers are present."
1,SCHEMA,Dual-evidence gate fails because the question can be mostly answered from SOURCE alone for green/climate details and from TARGET alone for report content; it is not clearly requiring both.
1,SCHEMA,Answer requires both SOURCE and TARGET but could be mostly answered from TARGET alone; minor reference to SOURCE only.
1,SCHEMA,Answer is mostly correct but includes some inferred details not explicitly stated in either passage.
1,SCHEMA,"Hard gate fail: The answer does not include both passage tags exactly as required; the SOURCE tag is embedded in text, not as a separate tag."
1,SCHEMA,"Answerable mostly from SOURCE alone; TARGET repeats the key requirement but adds no new detail, so dual-use gate fails."
1,SCHEMA,Answer is partially correct and grounded but adds some interpretation not explicit in texts.
1,SCHEMA,Hard gate fails because dual-evidence gate is not met; question can be answered correctly using SOURCE alone.
1,SCHEMA,"Both required passage tags are present, so hard gate 1 passes."
1,SCHEMA,"The question does not include rule or section identifiers, so hard gate 2 passes."
1,SCHEMA,"The question requires both SOURCE and TARGET to answer correctly, so hard gate 3 passes."
1,SCHEMA,The question is clearly realistic and natural for compliance (score 2).
1,SCHEMA,"Answering the question generally needs both passages but is borderline, as SOURCE focuses on Specified Investments and TARGET adds Regulated Activities (score 3)."
1,SCHEMA,The answer is partially correct but includes some unsupported details such as references to COBS and MKT rules and broader regulatory framework not fully supported by the TARGET or SOURCE texts (score 1).
1,SCHEMA,"Final score is realism (2) + dual_use (3) + correctness (1) = 6, which is below the threshold of 7."
1,SCHEMA,"Dual_use is 3, which meets the minimum for passing but final score is insufficient."
1,SCHEMA,"Therefore, passed is false and final_score is 6."
1,SCHEMA,"The answer requires both passages to be fully correct, as it references both COBS and MKT."
1,SCHEMA,dual_use: The question requires both SOURCE and TARGET but mostly can be answered from TARGET alone; SOURCE adds context but is not essential for the core answer.
1,SCHEMA,"correctness: The answer is mostly correct and grounded but includes some unsupported details (e.g., references to COBS and MKT rules broadly, and regulatory frameworks) that are not fully substantiated by the texts."
1,SCHEMA,Answer correctly states the obligation and its purpose based on both texts (correctness=4).
1,SCHEMA,"The question requires both passages to answer correctly, as it references both Specified Investments and Regulated Activities."
