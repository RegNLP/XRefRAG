Specifically, the refinancing should not aim to reclassify impaired credits as standard or special mention credits. This requirement is crucial to maintain the integrity of credit classifications and avoid artificially improving the credit status of loans that are contractually in arrears. The procedure mandates that Authorised Persons respect the classifications of exposures, such as special mention, substandard, doubtful, and loss, based on the number of days loans are in arrears. Therefore, while considering the treatments as set out, it is prohibited to manipulate the classification through refinancing in a manner that would elevate the credit category, thus ensuring accurate and fair reporting of credit statuses [#TGT:fc4bcf60-fc4a-4cd8-9848-a2bbcaaef228] as required [#SRC:2dd83781-93a2-4d56-a3fc-bf4665f983d5].", "debug_context": {"source_passage_id": "2dd83781-93a2-4d56-a3fc-bf4665f983d5", "target_passage_id": "fc4bcf60-fc4a-4cd8-9848-a2bbcaaef228", "source_text": "With respect to the ratings above, Authorised Persons should consider the following Exposures as being classified: (i) special mention; (ii) substandard; (iii) doubtful; and (iv) loss where the loans are contractually in arrears for a minimum number of days of 30, 60, 90 120 and 120 180 days respectively.

By keeping these exposures within the set limit, the Authorised Person can better manage its financial stability and reduce the risk of financial trouble.

Rule 7.2.1 is closely linked with other disclosure rules, like those in FSMR, ADGM Commercial Laws, and international laws for companies not in ADGM. Usually, the Listing Authority doesn't expect early disclosures unless certain conditions are met, like finding important information that needs to be shared immediately. This helps keep the market informed and prevents wrong information from spreading, fitting in with both regular financial and general disclosure rules [#SRC:e8a0c0b9-00fb-491e-988e-ef77853ed914] and [#TGT:05f69230-1c8e-4359-98fe-2f92e40b5e8f].", "debug_context": {"source_passage_id": "e8a0c0b9-00fb-491e-988e-ef77853ed914", "target_passage_id": "05f69230-1c8e-4359-98fe-2f92e40b5e8f", "source_text": "HOW DOES RULE 7.2.1 INTERACT WITH OTHER DISCLOSURE OBLIGATIONS?

For Digital Securities, the rules are similar, but the FSRA also expects the company to follow additional requirements, like possibly hiring a Sponsor to help with the listing process. This is because Digital Securities can be more complex. So, the company must make sure it has enough working capital and also meet any extra rules for Digital Securities, which might include getting expert advice [#TGT:c5ff4069-f284-4bb2-a504-11cf3694aa2e] and permitted [#SRC:e4b331b0-8437-43a6-8fa7-a77f476e8c3a].", "debug_context": {"source_passage_id": "e4b331b0-8437-43a6-8fa7-a77f476e8c3a", "target_passage_id": "c5ff4069-f284-4bb2-a504-11cf3694aa2e", "source_text": "MARKETS RULES LISTING RULES As set out earlier in paragraph 5, it is the FSRAs general expectation that its Regulations (FSMR) and Rules be read as written, including in relation to the Listing Rules (Chapter 2 of MKT).
